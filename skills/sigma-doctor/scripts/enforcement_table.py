"""Render `docs/enforcement.md`: what enforces each control, on which hosts, and its shipped default.

    python3 skills/sigma-doctor/scripts/enforcement_table.py > docs/enforcement.md

WHAT IT READS. (a) The `ENFORCEMENT_GATES` / `ENFORCEMENT_EXEMPT` tuples kept beside the gate code
in `skills/sigma-loop/scripts/{work,state,loop}.py`; (b) `hooks/hooks.json`, whose every command is
matched to a fact in `HOOK_FACTS` below (hooks.json says neither whether a hook blocks nor what
turns it on); (c) `skills/sigma-init/templates/config.json.tmpl`, for the value every enabling key
ships with; (d) `EXTERNAL_CONTROLS` below, for the controls no Python in the kit implements: skill
prose the agent is asked to follow, and the git host's own branch protection.

WHY AST, NOT IMPORT. `doctor.py`'s standing rule is no cross-skill import, and `work.py` imports its
siblings at module load. The registries are pure literals so `ast.literal_eval` on the module-level
`Assign` node is the whole reader -- nothing in those modules runs.

THE LIMIT. `problems()` fails on a module-level function whose name ends `_refusal`/`_gate`/`_hold`/
`_guard`, is `gate`, or contains `blocked_by` and is neither registered nor exempt. This proves only
what it enumerates: a gate whose function name does not follow the convention is invisible to it.
Registering such a gate is still required; this check just cannot notice when you forget.

A structural problem is a REFUSAL: each goes to stderr as `enforcement_table.py: REFUSED: ...`,
nothing reaches stdout, exit 2 -- so `> docs/enforcement.md` never half-writes the doc.
