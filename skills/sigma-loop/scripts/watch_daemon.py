"""Ledger watcher — keeps the shared ledger fresh and tells YOUR loop when a teammate needs you.

It runs against the ledger WORKTREE only (.sdlc/ledger, checked out to the ops branch), so
fetching every few minutes never touches your code checkout: no surprise rebase, no lost work.
Each tick: pull the ops branch -> classify what is addressed to you and not yet surfaced ->
write .sdlc/state/inbox.md -> check every claimed goal's registered agent marker for a
genuinely dead pid and notify (agent_watch.py, off by default — agent_watch.enabled) ->
check every claimed issue for new comments and notify the claimant (comment_watch.py, off by
default — comment_watch.enabled) -> apply reconcile.py's AUTOMATIC-tier board/label corrections
(reconcile_tick.py, #2294, off by default — discovery.reconcile.mode, same TTL-throttled sweep
next_batch already runs, now with a heartbeat independent of active picking) -> push a wake-up
event to the CLI/Channels adapter's local webhook for a new unactioned mention/assignment/blocker
(channel_notify.py, #1322, off by default — needs ledger.autowatch.enabled AND
channel_webhook_url set) -> post a passive feature-branch drift summary to Slack, ledger-deduped
across the whole team (drift_tick.py, #2311, off by default — needs ledger.enabled AND
drift_watch.enabled, own ttl_minutes cadence coarser than this loop's own tick) -> publish
anything of your own that is still local -> sleep.

The loop reads that inbox between goals (loop.py next prints it on stderr), which is the honest
delivery mechanism: nothing can inject a message into a running session, so the hand-off waits at
a boundary the loop already stops at. Worst-case latency is one goal.

#2499: watch.log is capped -- at the start of a tick the owner rolls it to ONE predecessor
(state/watch.log.1) once it reaches ledger.watch.log_max_bytes (default 1 MiB, clamped to 1% of
free disk, floor 64 KiB). Follow it with `tail -F`, not `tail -f`.

Stop it any time: touch <sdlc>/state/watch.stop
  watch_daemon.py [sdlc_dir]  (default .sdlc)
Env: SIGMA_WATCH_INTERVAL — seconds between ticks (default: config ledger.watch.interval_seconds, else 900);
     SIGMA_WATCH_MAX_TICKS — stop after N ticks (default 0 = forever; tests set a small number);
     SIGMA_WATCH_SLEEP_SCALE — multiply the wait (tests set 0; default 1);
     SIGMA_WATCH_CALL_TIMEOUT — per-sub-call wall-clock bound in seconds (default 120).
     Every one of them DEGRADES to its documented default with one tee'd warning if it does not
     parse (#2488 D-2), where the bash original aborted on two of them and silently ignored a
     third. A value that DOES parse is used verbatim, including 0 and negatives.

#1227: the "already running" guard below is PID-existence-plus-freshness, not PID-existence
alone. A bare `kill -0 $(cat watch.pid)` only proves SOME process currently holds that PID
number — the kernel has no "is this the same process that wrote the file" concept, so once a
watcher dies, the FIRST unrelated process the kernel later hands that PID number to makes the
guard read "already running" forever (confirmed: this is exactly how a 13-day-dead watcher on
the sdlc-ledger branch went undetected). The fix pairs the liveness probe with a per-tick
heartbeat file (<state>/watch.heartbeat, touched at startup and before every sub-call in the tick
loop) and a staleness bound (STALE_AFTER, derived from INTERVAL — see below): "already running"
now requires a live PID AND a heartbeat touched within STALE_AFTER seconds. A dead watcher's
leftover pidfile has no heartbeat at all (or a stale one), so it now reads dead even though the
liveness probe on its stale/reused PID still succeeds. This mirrors the pid_alive()-plus-mtime-TTL
idiom `loop.py`'s `_session_pid_live()`/`agent_alive()` already use for the identical class of
problem on their own markers (`ledger.py`'s `pid_alive()`/`DEFAULT_LEASE_TTL_HOURS`).

Residual risk, closed by #2416/#2443: all 8 tick-loop calls (sync.py pull, watch.py,
agent_watch.py, comment_watch.py, reconcile_tick.py, channel_notify.py, drift_tick.py, sync.py
publish) are wrapped via run_with_timeout.py with a real, bounded, configurable timeout
(SIGMA_WATCH_CALL_TIMEOUT, default 120s — see above), which kills the WHOLE process group on
overrun so a hung call -- or anything it spawns -- can no longer make a genuinely-alive watcher
look dead to a concurrent second invocation. Refreshing the heartbeat before each individual
sub-call (rather than once per tick) still matters with the timeout in place: it bounds a single
hung call's exposure to CALL_TIMEOUT itself, not the whole 8-call tick's duration, so a
concurrent second invocation never has to wait longer than one call's own bound before deciding
this watcher is genuinely alive.

#2488: this file is the Python port of the original `watch.sh`, with the same on-disk contract,
the same messages on the same streams, the same exit codes and the same 8-call order. It is
importable on purpose (D-3): every decision predicate here is a pure function of its inputs, so
the mutex, the staleness rule and the liveness conjunct are proved in-process in milliseconds
rather than only through ten-second subprocess races. bash's `set -uo pipefail` WITHOUT `-e` is
reproduced as: a failing command never aborts the script, and the only non-zero exit this file can
PRODUCE is main()'s one remaining deliberate refusal (an unwritable state dir).

#2498: this file used to refuse to start on win32 (D-6) because `ledger.pid_alive`'s
`os.kill(pid, 0)` calls `TerminateProcess` for any signal but CTRL_C_EVENT/CTRL_BREAK_EVENT there
-- a liveness probe that would have killed the very watcher it was checking. That refusal is now
REMOVED: `pid_alive()` below routes win32 through a dedicated ctypes OpenProcess/GetExitCodeProcess
probe instead (`_win32_pid_alive`), which has no code path that can terminate anything it checks.
#2494 validated this against a real windows-latest GitHub Actions runner (workflow run
34949212549): `_win32_pid_alive` correctly reads BOTH a genuinely-alive real PID (`os.getpid()`)
and a genuinely-exited real PID as alive/dead respectively, with zero mocking of `_win32_kernel32`
-- see `tests/test_windows_real.py::test_win32_pid_alive_against_real_processes`. The stop-file
mechanism was also proven real (`test_watch_daemon_stop_file_halts_on_windows`). `ledger.pid_alive` itself is deliberately UNCHANGED (see `pid_alive()`
below) -- its remaining win32 exposure for OTHER callers (`loop.py` claim-reclaim, and the CLI
channel adapter's own single-instance guard, #1322) is tracked separately as #2508. (Deliberately
not naming that adapter's module here at all: a #2396 scope-creep guard elsewhere in this repo's
test suite asserts a specific literal string never appears in THIS file, precisely so a stray
mention here can never be mistaken for real wiring between the two.)

# several loop.py calls close together, F10.5-3/#375) must not both pass this guard, run the loop
# concurrently, and contend on the ledger worktree's git index lock.
#
# An EARLIER version of this fix tried to make "evict a stale pidfile, then create fresh" itself
# race-safe via `mv`-based eviction plus a content-verify-and-restore step (mirroring loop.py's
# flock-based claim lock, F10.5-2/#387, which needed exactly that shape in Python). It reproduced a
# real double-win in roughly 1 of every 4 six-way concurrent-start test runs: racer B's `mv` can grab
# racer A's ALREADY-fresh pidfile (mv has no "is this still the same generation" signal, same as a
# plain unlink), and by the time B's verify step catches the mismatch and restores it, a THIRD racer
# C's own create can already have landed in the now-briefly-empty gap. Multi-step
# check-then-evict-then-verify-then-maybe-restore sequences have TOCTOU windows for EVERY step
# boundary, no matter how carefully each individual step is made atomic -- proven empirically here,
# not assumed.
#
# The fix: don't make the sequence itself race-safe -- make it NON-CONCURRENT. `mkdir` is a single,
# genuinely atomic POSIX operation (no partial states, no "verify identity" complexity a directory's
# mere existence can't already answer) used here purely as a short-lived MUTEX around the whole
# check+evict+create decision, held for a handful of near-instant local filesystem calls (no network,
# no sleep) and released immediately after -- not for the watcher's lifetime. `os.mkdir` raising
# FileExistsError is the same atomic signal, and is already used for exactly this purpose at

    Layer 1 is `os.mkdir(MUTEX)`. Layer 2 -- reached only when layer 1 found it held -- is the
    RECLAIM GATE. Independent review of an earlier version of this fix found and empirically
    reproduced (60-67% double-win at a 10-40 racer burst against a deliberately orphaned mutex, up
    to 7 processes alive at once) a second-order version of the exact bug this file exists to close:
    a plain, unguarded stat + age-check + rmdir + mkdir reclaim sequence has its OWN TOCTOU window,
    because nothing stops several racers who all read the SAME stale mtime from racing that
    four-step sequence against each other -- the identical shape as the original pidfile bug, one
    level down. Patching that sequence again would be the same mistake repeated; the fix is the SAME
    discipline applied one level deeper: gate the RECLAIM decision itself behind its own atomic
    mkdir, so at most one racer can ever be inside the stat-evict-create sequence at a time. A racer
    that loses THIS gate falls through with "not acquired" and backs off exactly like a racer that
    lost the outer one -- correct, since a sibling really is deciding, just one door in.

    `MUTEX.reclaim` gets no staleness recovery of its own -- the regress has to stop somewhere, and
    here is the right place: its critical section is even shorter than MUTEX's own (one stat, one
    comparison, at most one rmdir+mkdir pair), so a crash landing inside IT is rarer still, and
    unlike the bug being fixed, an orphaned reclaim gate fails SAFE -- every future racer just prints
    "a sibling is already deciding" and exits 0, an inert watcher (the ledger stops updating) rather
    than silent double-execution. Both backoff messages are tee'd to the log, not just echoed -- a
    real invocation (loop.py's _ensure_watcher) redirects stdout/stderr to /dev/null, so without that
    the "self-announcing" half of this trade-off would be theoretical only, visible in an interactive
    shell but silent in the one context this actually runs in (independent review caught this gap).
    A human clearing a stuck `.reclaim` directory by hand is an acceptable residual once it is
    actually discoverable via the log; two watchers quietly contending on the ledger's git index lock
    is not.

    EVERY filesystem call here catches `OSError`, not just `FileExistsError`. `watch.sh:111, 113,
    175, 176, 178, 219` every one carries `2>/dev/null`, which means bash read EVERY mkdir/rmdir
    failure -- ENOSPC, EACCES on a shared .sdlc, an NFS hiccup, EROFS -- as "not acquired" and exited
    0. A port that caught only FileExistsError would let those escape as a traceback and rc 1, at
    which point tests/test_watch.py's `_race` loser assertion goes red with `[rc=1]` in the
    diagnostic -- the right test failing for entirely the wrong reason."""

    The whole body is absorbed: bash ran under `set -uo pipefail` WITHOUT `-e`, so a failing command
    never aborted the script, and a port that lets an exception escape here is a regression. The
    message is the exception's CLASS NAME and never its text (plan-review finding 8): an OSError
    raised anywhere on this path routinely carries a sub-script path in its message, and
    tests/test_watch.py asserts `"drift" not in log` against a FIVE-character substring -- a `{exc}`
    catch-all would red that contract test the first time anything on the tick path failed, which is
    precisely when the log line matters most. The full traceback goes to stderr, where bash's own
    command errors went. That compensation is narrower than it reads: under `_ensure_watcher`'s
    `stdout=DEVNULL, stderr=DEVNULL` spawn (loop.py:61) the traceback is discarded, so the durable
    record of a repeating tick failure in the one context this actually runs in is a bare class name
    in watch.log. Still the right trade against reddening the absence assertions -- but a trade."""

    **This is the one place a straight transliteration silently regresses** (dossier §6.2, measured
    on this host). bash's `trap ... EXIT` fires on SIGINT (rc -2), SIGTERM (rc -15) and SIGHUP
    (rc -1), and not on SIGKILL. Python's `atexit`/`try...finally` fire on SystemExit and
    KeyboardInterrupt but **not** on SIGTERM or SIGHUP -- the default disposition terminates the
    interpreter without unwinding, leaving watch.pid + watch.heartbeat behind on every kill/pkill/
    logout: precisely the stale-marker shape #1227 exists to prevent. The Slack-commands listener
    installs the same SIGTERM/SIGHUP handlers around its own cleanup (#424).

    `getattr(signal, name, None)` is load-bearing: a bare `signal.SIGHUP` raises AttributeError on
    Windows, which is the platform this whole migration is for. Re-raising after restoring the
    default disposition reproduces bash's exit codes exactly AND keeps SIGINT from printing a
