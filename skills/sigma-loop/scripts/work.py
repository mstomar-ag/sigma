"""One worktree, one branch, one PR per goal — and a merge that must be clean AND safe.

THE PROBLEM. The moment the loop writes to git, two things break silently. It fights the human for
the working copy (an overnight `checkout -b` moves the tree out from under whatever they left open),
and — because `sigma-init` tells users to COMMIT `.sdlc/goals/` — every branch switch rewrites the
backlog the loop is in the middle of reading.

THE SHAPE. Each goal gets its own worktree, cut fresh from the integration branch, with its own
branch and PR. Consequences, all of them the point:

  * the human's checkout never moves and never changes branch, so `.sdlc/` stays put and every
    bookkeeping write (state, journey, goal frontmatter) lands in the ONE real copy;
  * cutting fresh from `<remote>/<base>` IS the goal-start rebase — there is nothing to replay, so
    it cannot conflict and cannot strand a half-applied tree at 3am;
  * a real rebase is needed only when GitHub reports the PR BEHIND — rare, reactive, re-checked
    after, and it ABORTS rather than leave the worktree wedged;
  * the worktree is where `verify_command` has to run: the main checkout does not contain the
    change. `root()` is what makes that resolution honest, and it is why a green verify means
    anything at all.

THE MERGE GATE. Clean is `mergeable`; safe is `mergeStateStatus`, which folds in required checks and
reviews. One `gh pr view` returns both. Four things this will not do: merge without fresh local
verify evidence from THIS run; trust a stale read; treat the usual first-read `UNKNOWN` as an answer;
or let `CLEAN` on a repo with no required checks pass for "reviewed" — it says so out loud instead.
Everything else parks with the reason. Zero deps.

THE LANDING IS A DIRECT `gh pr merge` (#1212), not an arm. Arming GitHub's own `--auto` is reserved
for the one case a direct merge would be refused right now — a required check that has not answered
yet, and only where the repo's `allow_auto_merge` permits arming. This paragraph used to describe
`--auto` as the general path, which it stopped being.

AND THE LANDING CLOSES AN ISSUE (#1649). On a base that is NOT the repository's default branch — a
goal cut onto `feature/<unit>` — GitHub will not honour a closing keyword, so `_pr_body` writes
`Refs #N` and names what will close it instead, and `merge()` performs the close itself over REST the
moment `gh pr merge` succeeds. That is a write to a GitHub issue from a function whose name says
merge, so it is stated here rather than left to be found: without it every issue landed through a
feature branch stays open, and every goal declaring `Blocked by: #N` stays held behind it.

# gate()/_reconcile_behind(), and the last two (#2009) by `ensure_fresh` on the resume path, where a
# stale worktree parks rather than proceeding. Not a human weighing a tradeoff, in any of the
# eight. #1185 shipped decision_tier gated on `reason_class == "unknown"`
# among others, then had to carve OUT the one case its own review caught (mergeability) with a
# needle hardcoded a second time in loop.py -- which left five siblings below it, all built the
# same way, still uncaught (also caught by review, of #1240). Fixed here, generalized: every return
# site below BUILDS its message from the matching constant rather than re-typing the wording inline,
# so this tuple is never a second description of the real strings that can quietly drift out of
# sync with them -- it Is the source of the real strings. loop.py's decision_tier gate reads this
# tuple directly (`work.MECHANICAL_PARK_PREFIXES`, lowercased for its case-insensitive match)
# instead of re-encoding its own copy of the wording, so a future edit to any one of these messages
# only has one place to go -- it can change what gets excluded, but it can never make the two files
# silently disagree about it the way a second, independent hardcoded needle could.

    `plan_sha256` is the `Plan sha256:` line of the brief written at DISPATCH time, never a rebuilt

    the REVIEWED copy (`main or branch`, see `plan_copies`) and, when both copies exist, the branch's
    too, so a verdict is recorded only for bytes every existing copy holds. A mismatch refuses and
    writes nothing: a refinement applied to the plan FILE takes it outside the approval, and the one
    documented path is a fresh plan-review of the refined plan.

    KEPT only while `work.enabled` is on AND this `sdlc_dir` holds the goal's work record. Its one

    start`, and a refusal would fail every such run even with the gate off. A run from a goal
    worktree (no work record there) therefore satisfies nothing, and `pr` still refuses.

    HONESTY. `reviewer_route` is what `reviewer.resolve` selects HERE, at record time, not proof of
    which route produced the verdict. Like `record_subagent_review`'s binding, the record is written
    by an agent: it proves a verdict was recorded for these bytes, not that an independent reviewer
    produced it. A determined maker can still hash an edited plan by hand; this stops honest drift.

    root — so a repo with the feature off behaves exactly as it did before. NEVER raises; `loop.py
    verify` calls it on every goal, and a bookkeeping problem must not stop a run.

    THE RECORD IS NOT THE ONLY EVIDENCE THAT A WORKTREE EXISTS (#1984, the checkbox that issue left
    deliberately open). `.sdlc/state/work/<goal>.json` is gitignored state and it is routinely
    absent: a worktree made by hand never gets one, and a lost record outlives nothing else. #1985
    made that fallback LOUD, which was the right first move and is what caught it — but the six
    goals in #1984 each had a perfectly good worktree sitting on disk at the conventional path the
    whole time. Falling back to the SHARED project root (another session's branch, 77 commits
    behind) while the goal's own tree was one `stat` away is the part worth fixing, not just
    announcing.

    #1984 framed the open question as "should verify REFUSE when the project root is on an unrelated
    branch?" and parked it because refusing parks goals. Recovering the worktree is the third
    option: it needs no policy decision, parks nothing, and removes the fallback from exactly the
    case that caused the incident. The project-root fallback stays for a goal that genuinely has no
    worktree — `#1985`'s warning still fires there, and now fires accurately.

    `start()` has recovered from a lost record since it was written (its "branch outlived its
    record" path). This is the SAME recovery on the read side, sound for the same reason: the
    worktree path is deterministic (`<worktree_dir>/<stem>`), so a missing record is a bookkeeping
    problem, never a missing tree. The record still goes FIRST — it is the only thing that knows
    about a worktree deliberately placed somewhere else.

    `stem(goal)` is embedded here as a real filesystem path component, so it takes
    `unsafe_goal_reason` exactly as `start()` and `record_path()` do — without it a traversing goal
    would aim the proving command at a directory outside `worktree_dir` altogether, the same class

    session it was written to protect: SKILL.md registers the agent, then invokes `work.py` as a
    child process, so the registered pid is never this process's own or its parent's. Absent, the
    comparison degrades to those two pids exactly as before — which refuses MORE, never less.

    #1197: `claim_belongs_to_me` gets the SAME `live_worker_check` `loop.py`'s own `_next()` passes
    — `loop.py`'s `_goal_has_registered_worker`, loaded lazily via `_load("loop")` INSIDE the
    lambda below, not at this module's own top level. That is deliberate, not merely a style
    choice: `loop.py` already does `work = _load("work")` at ITS OWN module top (`work.stem`,
    `work.root`, `work.enabled` — used throughout it), and this loader has no `sys.modules` cache
    of its own (see its docstring at the top of this file) — a top-level `_load("loop")` here would
    make loading either module first re-enter the other's top level, which re-triggers the first
    again, unbounded. Deferring the load into the lambda's own body sidesteps that entirely: it
    only ever runs if `claim_belongs_to_me` decides it needs to (the writer pid already confirmed
    dead — the lazy contract its own docstring documents), at which point `loop.py`'s top level has
    nothing left to finish loading that could re-enter back here. The one-time cost of a second,
    independent load of `loop.py` (and, transitively, of this very module again) on that path is
    negligible next to the `git`/`gh` subprocess calls `start()` already makes.

    #2394: `_goal_has_registered_worker` is called with `exclude_pids=_calling_session_pids
    (session_pid)` — the identical set `_blocked_by_a_live_foreign_agent` above already builds.
    Without it, the tie-breaker asked only "is ANY marker for this goal alive?" with no comparison
    against the calling session's own identity, so it counted the CALLER's own `agent-start` marker
    — written a moment earlier by SKILL.md step 3a, for this same session — as a different,
    still-live process, and `start()` refused to resume the worktree it had itself just cut. See
    `test_start_resumes_its_own_just_registered_worker_marker` (tests/test_work.py) for the
    reproduced failure.

    Deliberately `_goal_has_registered_worker` — the PER-GOAL marker only — not the OR'd, wider
    `_claimed_goal_has_live_worker` (which also folds in `session_active`, one marker for the whole
    `.sdlc`, true whenever ANY managing session is registered regardless of which goal it is
    working). Post-#1237-review correction: reusing the OR'd check here meant a long-lived managing
    session registered elsewhere could block resuming a DIFFERENT goal's worktree forever, even one
    whose own worker had genuinely crashed and never registered a marker at all — see
    `_claimed_goal_has_live_worker`'s own docstring in loop.py for the reproduced failure."""

    #1687. `os.getpid()`/`os.getppid()` are the ONLY two this ever knew, and between them they
    cannot name the process SKILL.md tells the agent to register. Step 3a is, in this order,
    `loop.py agent-start .sdlc "$goal" --pid $PPID` and then `work.py start .sdlc "$goal"` — so the
    registered pid is the AGENT's own stable process id, while `work.py` is a short-lived child of
    whatever shell the agent ran that second command in. `getppid()` is that shell; the agent sits
    at least one level above it. The goal's own driver was therefore classified as "a DIFFERENT
    live process" on every pick, which made `_rebase_upkeep` return "" every time (measured
    2026-08-24: `feature/derived-key-casing` 44 commits behind `main` across two picks, nothing
    printed) and broke the ordinary self-resume the same way.

    THE CALLER SAYS WHO IT IS; NOTHING IS INFERRED. `session_pid` is the identical `$PPID` capture
    `--session-pid` already carries into `loop.py start`/`next`/`next-batch` and `--pid` carries
    into `agent-start` — one identity contract, not a second one. The rejected alternative was to
    infer the answer from the process tree ("is the registered pid an ancestor of mine?"): that
    needs `ps`/`/proc` (no stdlib API, a subprocess on the pick path, nothing on Windows) and, worse,
    it assumes the agent's `$PPID` is a live ancestor of every command it runs — a claim about one
    host's process topology, which `AGENTS.md` forbids from ever being load-bearing. Recording more
    in the MARKER does not help either: the gap is not what the marker says, it is that the reader
    never learns who is asking, and a fresh `work.py` process cannot derive the caller's identity to
    compare against a richer marker any more than it can against this one.

    NARROWS NOTHING WHEN NOBODY IS NAMED. A `session_pid` that is absent, empty, `"true"` (what a

    drift, even though this file's `_flag` yields "" for that case) or unparseable degrades to the
    same two pids this always used — which REFUSES more, never less. Never raises, on any input.

    `> 0` REQUIRED, and this is the STRICTER of the two layers on purpose. `_looks_like_a_pid`
    turns junk away at the CLI with a warning, but defence in depth is worthless if the inner layer
    is the looser one: `0` is not a process here, it is `os.kill`'s whole-process-GROUP selector,

    `start()` is the only caller: everything downstream of it already reads the RESOLVED base out of
    the per-goal worktree record (`pr()`, `rebase()`, `protection()`), so resolving here is the whole
    change.

    `read_ok` IS THE THIRD RETURN AND IT IS NOT THE SAME QUESTION AS `unit`. It is False only when
    the read was ATTEMPTED AND FAILED — never when the issue simply declares nothing, and never when
    no read applied. It becomes `base_resolved` in the worktree record and in the durable action
    log, so a fallback base leaves a trace something can act on later instead of a line of stdout
    nobody reads at 3am.

    can be `.sdlc/goals/0002.md`, whose stem `isdigit()` accepts, and reading "issue #2" of whatever
    repo the checkout happens to point at could base a local goal on a stranger's feature branch.
    Outside the gate NO call is made at all, so every non-GitHub adopter keeps not just today's
    behaviour but today's exact call list — no new failure mode for them, not even a slow one.

    THE SLUG COMES FROM `_issue_repo` (#1649) — `discovery.github.repo`, falling back to gh's own
    `{owner}/{repo}` placeholders, the same two-step `sources._repo_args` already makes, and now
    shared verbatim with the close that ENDS the goal rather than spelled a second time here. The

    checkout that is a fork has a different issue #N, and basing a goal on what THAT issue declared
    is the kind of wrong that never announces itself. The template ships `repo` empty, so the
    placeholder fallback is the real install path, not a theoretical one. CONCEDED, because the two
    can disagree: `pr()` opens against `{owner}/{repo}` resolved from the worktree's own remote, so
    on a fork configured to file issues elsewhere the issue is read from one repo and the PR opened
    on another. `discovery.github.repo` is the right source for THIS read — it is where the goal
    number came from — and where they disagree the mismatch fails loudly at `git fetch` rather than
    quietly, but nothing here reconciles them. It now sits OUTSIDE the try, which loses nothing the
    old inline spelling had: `_issue_repo` cannot raise on any config shape (see its own docstring),
    so a hand-edited `discovery` block still degrades to "declared nothing" rather than taking out
    the goal it was asked about — the same "malformed config -> PROCEED" call `loop.py` already
    makes one layer up — and a malformed config is no longer reported as a failed network read.

    REST (`gh api repos/.../issues/<n>`), never `gh issue view` — `pr()`'s docstring carries the
    measurement: `issue view`/`pr view` are GraphQL under the hood and GitHub meters GraphQL on a
    SEPARATE hourly budget from REST, and an exhausted GraphQL quota has blocked this loop before
    (#1209) while REST still had headroom. The raw REST object is handed to `features.read`
    unreduced: its `labels` are `{"name": ...}` dicts, one of the two payload shapes that module is
    specified to accept, so no normalisation layer earns its keep here.

    FAIL-OPEN ON A FAILED READ, WITH A NOTE — and the note is the half that matters. `loop.py`'s own
    pick-time issue read degrades the same way ("malformed config -> PROCEED"), because a transport
    hiccup must not stop a goal that would have run fine yesterday; that is also what keeps the
    adoption promise honest, since an adopter using no units at all would otherwise gain a brand-new
    hard dependency on one more network call. But "the read failed" is NOT "the issue declares
    nothing", and collapsing the two is exactly how unit work lands on the integration branch with
    no trace. So the caller's one-line result says the question went unanswered. For the same
    reason an EMPTY or non-object reply counts as a failed read rather than an absent declaration:
    a real REST reply is always a JSON object (`fetch_comments_strict`'s own asymmetry, and
    `protection()`'s non-object-JSON fix), so an empty body, a `null` or a `[]` is a signal that
    something went wrong, not an answer to the question.

    THE ONE THING THAT IS NOT FAIL-OPEN is an issue that contradicts ITSELF — rival `Feature:`
    lines, a `Branch:` line that disagrees, two distinct `feature:` labels. `features.read` raises
    `AmbiguousUnit` there precisely because no rule could pick between two declarations a human
    wrote, and defaulting to the configured base would silently base unit work on the integration
    branch. It is re-raised as the SAME type, now naming the goal, which `main()` already turns
    into one message and a non-zero exit (`AmbiguousUnit` IS a `ValueError`, so nothing that catches
    the broader type changes). This refuses ONE goal, never the queue: `start()` is called per
    goal, which is the per-issue handling `read`'s docstring obliges every caller to provide.

    NOT DECIDED HERE, deliberately: whether a MISSING `feature:<name>` label should be attached
    (#1468 — automatic when the label exists, refuse-and-flag when it does not) and whether the
    branch exists at all (L2's registry). This resolves the base and nothing else. Meanwhile a unit
    whose branch is absent fails CLOSED anyway, because `start()`'s very next call is `git fetch
    <remote> <base>` and git refuses a ref it cannot find — loud, and never the wrong base."""

    path at all. The worktree cut below it comes from `<remote>/feature/<unit>`, so bringing that
    branch forward FIRST is what makes the new goal start current instead of inheriting exactly the
    staleness the pass exists to remove. Running it after the cut would maintain the branch for the
    NEXT goal and never for this one.

    THE UNIT IS HANDED IN, NOT RE-READ -- it is the same `_declared_unit` local `_sync_registry` was
    handed on the line above, so the whole feature costs zero additional issue reads.

    report and moves no branch on any of them; this guard covers the case where the module cannot
    even be loaded. Branch maintenance must never cost the goal -- a stale branch is a nuisance and
    a lost pick is a failure.

    NOT REACHED ON A RESUME, for the reason `_sync_registry` gives about itself: `start()`'s
    `already started` return is above this call, so a supervisor relaunch neither syncs nor rebases.
    A resume is the same pass continuing, and force-pushing a shared branch every time a supervisor
    restarts an agent is not maintenance.

    AND NOT REACHED AT ALL WHEN A DIFFERENT LIVE PROCESS OWNS THIS GOAL. That question is already
    asked twice below — once on the `already started` fast path and once on the narrower `branch
    outlived its record` path — but BOTH sit under this line, and the second one is reached only
    after `git worktree add -b` has failed. So on that path the old ordering had already
    force-pushed the shared feature branch and replayed the unit's sibling goal branches by the
    time `start()` discovered it must return REFUSED and touch nothing. Asking here, first, costs
    a few local file reads (`_resume_blocked_by_a_live_sibling` is markers and the ledger, no
    network) and makes the refusal mean what it says. Fail-open, exactly as that function is:
    an unreadable marker must narrow nothing.

    #1687: AND IT IS TOLD WHO IS ASKING. `session_pid` reaches the liveness comparison inside that
    guard; without it the caller's OWN agent registration read as a foreign process and this

    #1687, second half: WHEN IT DOES SKIP, IT SAYS SO — BUT ONLY WHEN THERE WAS SOMETHING TO SKIP.
    This used to return the empty string, and the outcome never reached `feature_rebase.clause()`
    either, so a skipped pass wrote nothing to stdout, nothing to stderr and nothing to the action
    log — the pick line was byte-identical to a healthy one. That silence is the whole reason the
    bug above survived; a branch left behind must cost one clause on the line whoever ran the pick
    is already reading. `_upkeep_had_anything_to_do` is what keeps that clause TRUE: the guard is
    asked before `upkeep()` and therefore before ITS three cheapest gates, so an unconditional
    clause claimed a stale `feature/None` for a goal declaring no unit, named a `feature:` taxonomy
    label as a branch in a repo that never adopted the model, and contradicted an operator who had

    #1467 F1, and it is a defect this goal itself introduced. On this path nothing is cut: the
    branch already exists, with a base of its own, and `git worktree add <path> <branch>` re-attaches
    it. Persisting the base we just RE-RESOLVED is therefore a guess about somebody else's branch —
    and `pr()` sends `rec["base"]` as the PR's target while `rebase()` replays the branch onto it, so
    a wrong guess retargets a PR or rebases unit work onto the integration branch.

    THE PRECONDITION IS ROUTINE. `finish()` removes the worktree and unlinks the record but KEEPS the
    branch — the documented `auto_merge: off` / fork / read-only path where a goal records `review`
    with its PR still open (`done` only once it merges, #232). A later start on that goal lands here.

    WHY THIS WAS NOT A BUG BEFORE #1467, which is also the shape of the fix: the old base was
    `s["base"] or HEAD`, deterministic from config, so re-resolving reproduced the same answer and
    overwriting was a no-op. A DECLARED base is not deterministic across two starts — a failed read
    (the wrong `gh` account returns 404 on a private repo, a 403, an outage) or a human removing the
    `feature:` label between them both change the answer. So re-resolution is only trusted where it
    still cannot vary: `_declaration_moves_the_base` false, i.e. exactly the pre-#1467 world.

    Otherwise the branch's ACTUAL base must be discovered, and three oracles are asked in order —
    they fail in different directions, which is why there is more than one:

      0. THIS GOAL'S OWN WORK RECORD (`rec["base"]`, handed in by the caller) — and it outranks the
         other two because it is not evidence ABOUT the base, it IS the field being written:
         `pr()` sends `rec["base"]` as the PR target and `rebase()` replays onto it, so a record
         that already says `feature/x` makes writing anything else the retarget this whole function
         exists to prevent. Present on exactly one of the two ways this path is reached — the
         worktree DIRECTORY vanished (a `git worktree remove`, a `prune`, a wiped scratch dir) while
         the record and branch survived. `finish()`'s path unlinks the record, so there it is None
         and the older oracles below are all there is (#1572);
      1. the durable ACTION LOG (`_branch_base_from_log`) — ours, written by the `start()` that cut
         the branch, and untouched by `finish()`; survives `pr()` but is opt-in and OFF by default;
      2. git's own UPSTREAM (`_branch_base_from_upstream`) — zero-config and always there, but
         `pr()`'s `push -u` overwrites it, so it answers only before a PR exists.

    None answers => REFUSE, loudly, rather than record a base nobody established. That is the one
    behaviour change on this path, it is narrow (github-mode goals in an ADOPTED repo whose branch
    outlived its record with no record, no action log and no upstream), and the alternative is
    silently retargeting a PR. THE REMEDIES IT NAMES HAVE TO BE PERFORMABLE (#1572): the message
    leads with `git branch --set-upstream-to`, which is exactly what oracle 2 reads next, so it
    unblocks THIS run; deleting the branch is named with what it destroys rather than offered flat,
    because the reachable shape of this failure has an open PR built on that branch; and
    `action_log.enabled` is named for what it is — a fix for the next cut, not for this one.

    #1571: the "can the answer vary?" question is `_declaration_moves_the_base`, which folds in
    whether the project adopted the model at all. A repo with no `.sdlc/features/` resolves
    `work.base or HEAD` no matter what its issues are labelled, so it belongs on the deterministic
    side with local mode — refusing it would be refusing a goal whose base never moved."""

    `commit()`'s `git add -A` only ever runs with `cwd=<worktree>` (see
    test_commit_only_ever_touches_this_goals_worktree), so it structurally cannot see dirt sitting
    in the ROOT checkout instead. Tracked, uncommitted edits there — on the branch `work.base`
    names, the one every goal's worktree is cut FROM — can only mean an edit landed straight in
    root instead of a worktree (#2014): the exact mistake AGENTS.md's "nobody commits directly to a
    feature branch" section exists to prevent, one level up, on the integration branch itself.

    NARROW ON PURPOSE. Untracked scratch (`??` in `git status --porcelain`) is never touched here —
    only lines that are NOT `??` count as dirt. And this only ever fires on `s["base"]` itself: a
    maintainer's real, deliberate WIP on some other branch in root (a release branch, a hotfix) is
    not the failure mode this catches, since no goal is ever cut from anything but the base. With no
    `work.base` configured there is no stable reference point for "no branch" — treating the current
    HEAD as base would degrade this into "any tracked dirt anywhere refuses", which is not what
    #2014 asks for, so the check is off entirely (zero git calls) until a base is set.

    FAILS OPEN on any git error (no repo, git not installed, ...) — same posture as the

def start(sdlc_dir, config, goal, run=None, session_pid=None):
    """Cut a fresh worktree + branch from the tip of THIS GOAL'S base. Idempotent, and
    resumable: the record lives in gitignored state, so a supervisor relaunch re-attaches instead of
    starting a second worktree for the same goal — whether the record is still there (`already
    started`) or was lost while the branch/worktree survived (`branch outlived its record`, below)
    — but ONLY once `_resume_blocked_by_a_live_sibling` confirms that goal's ledger claim (if the
    ledger is on) is genuinely safe to treat as mine to resume, not another still-live process of my
    own actor's in-flight work (F10.5/#374; the fallback path closed by #388).

    Checked FIRST, before any git call: `stem(goal)` feeds directly into the real worktree
    filesystem path below (`base_root / s["worktree_dir"] / stem(goal)`) with no reduction of its
    own — unlike `record_path()` (fixed alongside this, #486/PR #487's independent review), an
    unsafe goal here would make `git worktree add` create a REAL checkout outside the intended
    `worktree_dir` entirely, not just misplace a JSON file. Same validator, same reasoning.

    THE BASE IS RESOLVED PER GOAL (#1467): the unit the issue declares (`feature/<name>`), else
    `work.base`, else the current HEAD. `_declared_unit` carries the whole argument; what matters
    here is the ORDER — the declaration wins over config, and a goal declaring nothing runs the
    identical fallback expression it always has. The resolved base is what lands in the record, so
    `pr()`, `rebase()` and `protection()` follow it with no change of their own — and it lands there
    beside `base_resolved`, False when the declaration could not be READ, so a fallback base leaves
    a durable trace rather than one line of stdout. RESOLVED ONCE, NOT AGAIN: on the
    branch-outlived-its-record path nothing is cut, so `_reattach_base` recovers the base the branch
    genuinely has — starting from the record this function is already holding (#1572) — instead of
    overwriting it with a fresh guess.

    AND ONLY WHERE THE MODEL WAS ADOPTED (#1571): a declaration decides the base only in a project
    with a `.sdlc/features/` directory, the same one-`stat` gate the six feature modules ask before
    acting on a unit. Everywhere else a `feature:*` label is an issue CATEGORY — a taxonomy older
    than this plugin — and the base falls through to the identical `work.base or HEAD` expression it
    always was. The unit is still resolved and still handed to the registry passes, so the "you
    declared a unit and nothing recorded it" note keeps firing.

    `session_pid` (#1687) is who is asking — the agent's own `$PPID`, from `--session-pid`. Every
    liveness gate on this path takes it (both resume gates and `_rebase_upkeep`), because the agent
    SKILL.md step 3a just registered is the parent of the shell that ran this command, not of this
    process, and a gate that cannot recognise its own caller refuses every pick. Optional
    everywhere: omitted, each gate falls back to `{getpid(), getppid()}` and narrows nothing new.

    CHECKED SECOND, before even the resume record (#2014): `_dirty_root_refusal` asks whether the
    ROOT checkout itself — not this goal's worktree — is sitting on `work.base` with tracked,
    uncommitted edits. That state can only mean someone edited straight in root instead of cutting a
    worktree first, on every path this function has (fresh cut or resume alike), so it is asked
    before either is chosen."""

    purpose by repos that did nothing wrong, and refusing them would wedge a run over a file whose
    whole job is to be published. The exemption is per-extension because the convention is: a `.pem`
    is as often a certificate as a key, while a `.key` next to one is the private half — so `ca.pem`
    passes and `ca.key` does not. `.p12`/`.pfx`/`.jks`/`.keystore` get no exemption at all; those
    formats always carry a private key.

    THINGS IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT MATCH, each because the false-positive rate would exceed the harm
    caught: `env.sh` (no leading dot — a shell script, and `scripts/env.sh` is a common harmless
    one), `.envrc` (direnv config, usually committed, and not an `.env.<x>` variant), and `*.pub`.
    And one it matches KNOWING it will sometimes be wrong: `*.key` is also a Keynote deck and, in
    some projects, an i18n key file. Name matching cannot tell those from `deploy.key`, and the
    reversibility argument in `_secret_refusal` says which way to be wrong — so those go through
    `work.allow_secret_paths`, and `/sigma-doctor` surfaces them at adoption rather than mid-run."""

    secret-shaped basename is one a human chose, and the denylist reads that choice as a warning.
    Here the kit chose it: `feature_registry.unit_path` turns a unit name — already validated by
    `is_unit_name`, then folded — into `<name>.json` in this directory and nowhere else. A unit may

    IT FAILS CLOSED, and that is the OPPOSITE of `_phase_doc_missing_from_branch`'s call below. Not an
    inconsistency: the two harms differ in REVERSIBILITY, which is the only thing that should decide
    a guard's direction. A refusal issued in error costs an operator minutes and leaves the branch,
    the worktree and the files exactly as they were. A credential that reaches a remote is in a PR,
    in forks, in caches and in whatever mirrored it, and the only real remedy is rotation. When the
    two directions are not symmetric, the guard goes the way of the recoverable failure.

    A DELETION IS NEVER AN OFFENDER. `git diff --cached --name-only` lists what the index CHANGES,
    which includes paths being REMOVED — so a first draft of this guard refused the one operation it
    exists to enable: a goal whose entire purpose is "delete the leaked `.env` and ignore it" was
    refused, permanently, and told to untrack a file it had just deleted. Dropping `D` before
    anything else is also what makes the tracked-file remedy terminate: `git rm --cached` leaves a
    staged deletion, which as an offender would refuse the very next run.

    THE UNSTAGE IS NOT TIDINESS — it is what makes the refusal SATISFIABLE. By the time this runs,
    `git add -A` has already put the offender in the index, and an indexed path IS a tracked path:
    `.gitignore` stops applying to it. So "ignore it and re-run" — the remedy this text names —
    would be a lie, `commit()` would refuse again on the next call and the next, and the only exit
    left would be `git add -f`, the exact hole #1504 exists to keep shut. A refusal that cannot be
    satisfied is a bug, not a safeguard. See `_unstage` for why it is per-path rather than a bare
    `git reset`. If it fails, this still refuses — a cleanup that did not happen makes the refusal
    harder to satisfy, it does not make the credential safe to commit — and the text then says the
    paths are still staged instead of claiming a reset that never occurred.

    WHICH REMEDY IS NAMED comes from git's own status letter, never a guess. `A` is new to the
    branch and ignoring it is enough. Anything else is already tracked, and `git add -A` re-stages a
    tracked path whatever `.gitignore` says — so that one is sent to `git rm --cached` FOLLOWED BY
    the ignore rule (either alone leaves it staged), or, for a file the repo commits ON PURPOSE
    (a Symfony-style non-secret `.env` is the common one), to the allowlist. An UNMODIFIED tracked
    secret never reaches here at all: `add -A` stages nothing for it, so it is absent from `staged`.
    That is deliberate too — it is already in the branch's history, so it is a rotation problem
    rather than one this commit is creating, and refusing every future commit over it would wedge
    the repo with no reachable remedy."""

    """risk-detect.sh's `matched` list for the change staged in `path` — [] on anything unreadable.

    WHY HERE AND NOT AT REVIEW. The obvious home is the Review phase, where `sigma-review`'s own
    prose already runs this detector. Measured on this repo: the loop reviews the PR's diff
    *post-commit, post-push* (SKILL.md §"Then REVIEW the PR you just opened"), and the tripwire reads
    the working tree, the index and untracked files — all three empty by then. Run against a clean
    tree it returns `{"matched":[],"hits":[]}`; run against the same change staged it returns
    `{"matched":["migration"],...}`. A Review-phase emitter would therefore record "no risk" on every
    goal, for every change, forever — a green light nothing measured. `commit()` is the one point in
    the loop where the change is both attributable to a goal and still visible to the scan.

    It also makes the emitter DETERMINISTIC CODE rather than SKILL prose. Cursor has no hooks and
    reads its `.mdc` as text, so a trigger that lives in an agent instruction is load-bearing on
    exactly one host; this one runs wherever `work.py commit` runs, which is everywhere.

    FAIL-OPEN, and never `run`. `subprocess` directly, mirroring `pipeline.discover`'s own call to
    discovery-scan.sh: the injected `run` is the goal's git/gh channel, and routing a collector
    through it would put a non-git call into the ordered command list
    `test_commit_makes_exactly_the_same_calls_when_nothing_staged_is_secret_shaped` pins. A missing
    bash, a missing script, a non-git tree or unparseable stdout all yield [] — a journal read never
    fails a commit.

    COST: one `bash` fork per commit, doing one `git diff --cached` plus a single-pass awk over that
    diff. Linear in the size of the change already staged, with no network and no LLM; the scan the
    Review phase was already paying for, moved to the one place it can see anything."""

    """#910: one `gate` event per risk category this commit tripped. Same emitter as the four gates
    already in this file (`post_review`, `merge`, `code_review`, `test_trust`) — no new event kind,
    no schema change. The vocabulary already declared every `risk_*` gate, so a downstream reader
    that reads `gate` events generically receives these rows for free — measured when #910 landed,
    on a real downstream store built from a real `work.py commit`: its gate-catch metric returned
    `risk_migration` as its own row (one gate event, zero catches, reliability class 2), and
    a weekly aggregate with no gate column counted both.

    THE VERDICT IS ALWAYS `absent`, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT. risk-detect.sh's own header says it
    "detects the TRIGGER only; it does not run the risk skills and cannot verify they ran". `pass`
    off that signal would assert a review that never happened; `warn` already means something else
    in this file (`merge()` uses it for "the gate evaluated and flagged a caveat"), and reusing it
    for "nothing evaluated" would collide two different facts onto one value. `absent` is the
    vocabulary's own ABSENT != PASS value and says exactly what is true: this gate APPLIED to this
    change, and no risk-skill verdict is recorded against it. When a risk skill does start reporting
    its own verdict, it overwrites nothing — it adds a row this one can be told apart from.

    A CATEGORY THAT DID NOT MATCH EMITS NOTHING. A `gate` row means "this gate applied", which is
    #911's "applicable as a recorded fact"; a row for a gate that did not apply would empty that
    meaning, and there is no verdict in the closed vocabulary that means "not applicable" (`pass` is
    the dangerous one — a downstream catch rate divides by every gate row it sees). The residual
    conflation is real and belongs to #911: no row still cannot separate "did not apply" from "never
    measured". A `scan` event was considered as that denominator and rejected on measurement --
    a downstream ingester's payload map carries no `category`, `file` or `count`, so the record would
    reach its event table as an undiscriminated `kind='scan'` row whose only tell apart from a
    discovery scan is pipeline.py's `(discovery-scan)` goal_id sentinel. A named absence beats a
    denominator that cannot be read.

    NOT ADDED TO `loop.py`'s `_EMIT_GATE_KINDS`, and it must not be. That allowlist is what stops an
    agent typing `emit ... gate --gate risk_security --verdict pass` by hand; this path derives both
    the gate and the verdict from the detector's output and takes neither from an argument, so it
    needs no widening and gets none. `risk_*` stays reliability class 2 in a downstream reader for
    the same reason. Both pinned below."""

    The loop is deliberately given no general `git` tool: a verb that can only ever run `-C <this

    exists. That containment argument is about BLAST RADIUS WITHIN THE FILESYSTEM, and it says
    nothing about WHAT GETS STAGED — the two are orthogonal, and reading the first as covering the
    second is how `git add -A` came to stage an adopter's unignored `.env` unattended, on every
    goal, with a PR at the end (#1555). `_secret_refusal` is that second axis; see it for the

    "" otherwise. Shared by `_plan_missing_from_branch` (`plans`, #1548 — the original) and
    `_research_missing_from_branch` (`research`, #1801); `label` is only the noun the refusal names.

    WHY THIS IS EVEN POSSIBLE. Both phases file their artifact — `.sdlc/plans/<stem>.md` or
    `.sdlc/research/<stem>.md` — in the MAIN checkout (SKILL.md 3a: bookkeeping stays there; Research
    runs before 3a ever cuts a worktree, so for it there is no worktree to write into even in
    principle), while `commit()`'s `git add -A` runs inside the goal's WORKTREE. Two different trees,
    so the artifact is never a candidate for the branch — it does not go missing, it was never
    offered. The branch then reaches a reviewer whose job is to check the change against it, without
    it (#1548 for the plan; #1801 measured the identical gap for the research dossier — 228 files on
    disk, 0 tracked, 0 published, repo-wide). Both reviewers on the run that surfaced #1548 noticed
    and neither could fail it, because nothing mechanical asked.

    THE LINE BETWEEN AN ARTIFACT AND RUNTIME STATE IS DRAWN BY THE REPO'S OWN IGNORE RULES, not by a
    policy invented here. A `.sdlc/` path in a PR is normally WRONG — that is #1504's territory, and
    one such file is tracked on this repo's `main` from before the ignore rule. So:

      * `git check-ignore` matches the path -> this repo has already decided this kind of artifact is
        not a committed one here, and the ONLY way to satisfy a demand would be the `git add -f`
        #1504 exists to stop. Say nothing.
      * it does not match -> the path is already committable by the repo's own rules (the kit's own
        adoption path ignores only the runtime subdirs — `setup.py`'s `RUNTIME_IGNORES` lists
        `state/ ledger/ work/ knowledge/ events/`, and pointedly not `plans/` or `research/`). A
        plain `git add` fixes it. Refuse.

    So this guard can never widen what `.sdlc/` means, in either direction: it demands nothing a
    repo's `.gitignore` does not already permit, and it never writes the file itself. A tool that
    PLACED the artifact on the branch would be the accidental-commit failure mode wearing a fix's
    clothes; this one reports and lets the goal act.

    THREE OUTCOMES, ALL POSITIVELY SIGNALLED — which is why this asks with `-v --non-matching` and
    not with `-q`. `-q` answers "no pattern matched" with a SILENT non-zero exit, which `_run` turns
    into an exception indistinguishable from git failing to read the rules at all; one catch would
    then have to treat both alike, and whichever way it went, one of them would be wrong. Measured
    against real git, `-v --non-matching` makes git say which is which: a covered path exits 0; an
    uncovered one exits non-zero carrying `::\t<path>` (git's `<source>:<line>:<pattern>` with all
    three fields empty); a genuine failure — a path outside the repo, an unreadable `.gitignore`, a
    wedged worktree — carries git's own diagnostic instead. Only the middle one refuses.

    A failure to READ the rules is not an answer ABOUT them, so it FAILS OPEN. That direction is not
    a preference. The remedy this refusal names is "copy it in, then `work.py commit`", and
    `commit()` is `git add -A`, which honours `.gitignore` — so a refusal issued by mistake against
    a repo that DOES ignore this artifact is unsatisfiable: the copy stages nothing, `commit` reports
    `nothing to commit`, `pr` refuses again, forever. Failing open costs one unnoticed artifact, and
    the PR review that reported #1548 is exactly what catches it. Failing closed on a misread wedges
    the run and puts `git add -f` in front of whoever has to get it out — the #1504 hole this guard
    is otherwise careful never to widen."""

    `branch` is the goal worktree's copy, found by the SAME resolver under `<worktree>/<sdlc name>`,

    honours a closing keyword only when the pull request carrying it merges into the repository's
    DEFAULT branch; a merge into any other base leaves the keyword inert and the issue open. Under
    the branching model a goal's PR targets `feature/<unit>`, so this is the difference between a
    body that tells the truth and one that asserts, in writing, a close nothing performs — measured
    on every goal of the 1.4.0 epic and again in the adoption trial, each of which stayed open until
    a human closed it by hand.

    REST (`gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}`), never `gh repo view` — the same separate-quota reasoning
    `pr()`'s own docstring carries, and the exact call shape `_auto_merge_allowed` below already
    makes for the neighbouring repo setting. gh's `{owner}/{repo}` placeholders resolve from the
    worktree's remote, which is the repo the PULL REQUEST lives in — the only repo whose default
    branch can decide this, even where the ISSUE is filed elsewhere (`_issue_repo`).

    "" ON ANY FAILURE, and every caller reads that as "not the default branch", because a base
    string is never empty so `base == _default_branch(...)` is False whenever the read fails. That
    direction is chosen, not incidental: being wrong toward "it IS the default" writes the false
    keyword this exists to stop and strands the issue open — the whole defect — while being wrong
    the other way costs one accurate-but-cautious sentence in a PR body. #2615: `merge()`'s own
    close clause no longer calls this at all — `_close_issue_the_base_cannot` reads the issue's own
    live state instead of any base — so `_pr_body` is this helper's only remaining caller. Read
    FRESH there rather than measured once and cached in the goal's record: what matters is what

    they have no body (#816: `commit()`'s own default, `f"sdlc: {stem(goal)}"`, guarantees that,
    and an ordinary one-line conventional subject causes it too). NUL-delimited per-commit (`%x00`)
    so a commit body containing a blank line can never be mistaken for the separator between
    commits. Never empty: `pr()` already refuses to reach here with zero commits, so `commits`
    always has at least one entry; the issue-link prefix adds a second non-empty source when one
    exists.

    `ref.isdigit()` ALONE is not enough to decide "this is a github issue number" (a real bug an
    independent review of #816 caught, live, before merge): a LOCAL-mode goal can have a purely
    numeric filename stem too — `.sdlc/goals/0002.md` -> stem `"0002"` -> `isdigit()` True, and
    `triage.py`'s own comments use exactly that filename as their illustrative example of a normal
    local goal id. Gating on `discovery.source == "github"` too is what stops a local goal from
    getting a false `Closes #<n>` injected into its PR body, silently closing an unrelated real
    issue on an auto-merge this tool is designed to run unattended. That pair of conditions is
    `_reads_a_declaration`, not a third spelling of it (#1649): the same call `_declared_unit` and
    `start()` already make, and — the reason it matters here — the same call
    `_close_issue_the_base_cannot` makes, so the header written at PR time and the close performed
    at merge time can never disagree about whether this goal has a GitHub issue at all.

    AND THE BASE, WHICH THIS USED TO IGNORE (#1649). `Closes #N` is inert unless the PR merges into
    the DEFAULT branch, so writing it against `feature/<unit>` asserted something GitHub would not
    do — and, once the dependency gate landed, deadlocked every goal declaring `Blocked by:` that
    one. When the base is not confirmed to be the default branch the header REFERENCES the issue
    instead of claiming it, and names what will actually close it. Going quiet was not an option:
    a body that simply omits the line leaves the reader with the same wrong belief the false line
    gave them, and the reader here is often another agent. Nor is a note elsewhere — the defect is
    a machine-written line that says something untrue, and only this line can stop saying it.

    THE HONEST HEADER CONTAINS NO `<keyword> #<n>` PAIR anywhere, which is what GitHub's linker
    actually matches — "closing keyword" as prose is fine, "closes #816" is not, and the difference
    is the whole point rather than a style preference. `Refs #<n>` still cross-references the issue,
    so the PR remains visible from it exactly as before; only the CLAIM is withdrawn."""

    missing the plan or research dossier it is meant to be read against (#1548, #1801) — rather than
    opening a PR that says nothing, or one a reviewer cannot check.

    THE PLAN CHECK LIVES HERE, not in `commit()` and not in the Plan phase — for three reasons, and
    "`pr()` runs once" is not among them. It does not run once: SKILL.md's blocked-review cycle
    mandates `work.py commit` AND `work.py pr` again on every fix, up to `work.max_review_cycles`,
    so BOTH verbs repeat and "the refusal would nag" fails to separate the two sites at all. What
    does separate them:
      * `pr()` is the LAST gate before the branch becomes visible, and visibility is the whole harm
        — the plan is what the PR's reviewer checks the change against, so publication is the
        moment its absence starts costing something. `pr()` already owns exactly that question
        ("is this branch fit to be seen"); a branch without its plan is another case of it.
      * Refusing a PUSH leaves the branch, its commits and the worktree precisely as they were,
        with the fix one commit away. Refusing a COMMIT strands the work uncommitted — a worse
        place to leave an unattended run than the one the refusal was trying to prevent.
      * `commit()` can be skipped for a whole run; `pr()` cannot. `start()`'s
        branch-outlived-its-record path re-attaches a worktree to an EXISTING branch (no `-b`), so
        a session can inherit commits it never made and reach `pr()` having called `commit()` zero
        times. A check living in `commit()` would simply never run for that goal.
    Committing the plan (or the research dossier) from the Plan (or Research) phase instead is worse
    again: `sigma-plan` and `sigma-research` are both PORTABLE executors that also run where there is
    no worktree and `work.enabled` is off, so a git write there is wrong or inert on those hosts, and
    it would make the tool place a `.sdlc/` path on a branch on its own initiative — see
    `_phase_doc_missing_from_branch` for why that is the failure being fixed, not a fix.

    Every GitHub call here is REST (`gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/...`), never `gh pr
    list`/`gh pr create`/`gh pr view` -- those three subcommands are GraphQL operations under the
    hood (`query PullRequestList`, `mutation PullRequestCreate`, `query PullRequestByNumber`,
    confirmed against the installed gh binary), and GitHub meters REST and GraphQL on SEPARATE
    hourly budgets (`gh api rate_limit` returns distinct `core` and `graphql` buckets). An
    exhausted GraphQL quota was blocking PR creation even while the REST budget still had
    headroom to serve these same three reads/writes (#1209) -- the same doctrine this codebase
    already applied once, to issue comments, for the identical separate-bucket reason.

    `{owner}`/`{repo}` are gh's own placeholders, substituted from the worktree's git remote --
    the same pattern `protection()` below (`gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}`) already uses, not a
    second convention. The find-existing read filters on `head={owner}:<branch>` (REST's own
    fork-aware filter format); this tool only ever pushes to its own remote, never a fork, so
    `{owner}` on both sides of that filter is always the same repo owner. The create call's REST
    response already carries `number` in the same JSON object the API returns for a brand-new
    PR, so `--jq .number` on that ONE call replaces both the old `pr create` and the old
    `pr view` -- one fewer network round trip than the three gh-CLI calls this replaces, not a
    same-count swap."""

    normally UNKNOWN, so treating that as an answer either parks every PR or merges blind.

    STALE HEAD is checked FIRST, and it is not a nicety. `work.py commit` commits LOCALLY; only

    Not hypothetical: three times in one run. #190 merged its first commit instead of its reviewed

    MERGED. Called from loop.py's `record` dispatch before `_record()` runs, and by the
    merge-reconcile pass before it records the `done` a later merge earns.

    OWNER DECISION (issue #232, 2026-09-29): "done only after merge. `record done` and issue close
    require the PR merged; an unmerged PR leaves the goal in review/QC." So, with `work.enabled` and a
    PR on record, the ONLY pass is a positively confirmed merged PR. That replaces #254's policy-aware
    fail-open (armed / `auto_merge: off` / fork / read-only / protected-but-unguarded / unreadable all
    used to allow `done`), which on the shipped defaults closed issues whose PRs never merged and
    whose review gate never ran. The fail-open existed because a false refusal used to WEDGE an
    unattended run; it no longer can: every refusal below names `record review` (or `parked`), a
    non-terminal outcome that is always available, and the merge-reconcile pass finishes the goal
    when the PR lands. Refusing on an unreadable read is therefore safe in both directions -- the
    issue stays open (never falsely closed), and nothing is stranded.

    Unchanged: `work.enabled` off (no PR is ever opened -- nothing to confirm) and no PR on record (a
    docs-only / no-diff goal legitimately never opens one) both return None without a read.

    MERGED replays the per-sink merge-delivery receipt, exactly as before: a direct merge, a later
    `record done`, and the reconcile pass all converge on the same ownership/merge-SHA-derived keys,
    so a crash between the two sinks is retried rather than lost.

    #144's tree guard (`feature_rebase.dropped_paths`), reused before this force-push too. A goal
    branch has a single writer, but the data-loss shape is the same: when the goal's commit reached
    the base as a patch-equivalent copy (a rebase-merge) and was then REVERTED there, `git rebase`
    skips it as already upstream and the replay silently loses the goal's own work.

    Scoped to the paths the goal changed since it forked (`git diff --name-only <merge-base> pre`),
    and that scope is deliberate: unscoped, `dropped_paths` refuses a plain base deletion of a file
    the goal never touched -- routine on a busy base, and `ensure_fresh` runs this before every
    verify, so every goal would stall on an ordinary cleanup. The cost of the scope: a goal whose
    commits reached the base as the SAME commits (a true merge) and were then reverted forks above

    finished goal is not a flow this function serves. Fails closed: a comparison that cannot be
    made defers the rebase too.

    string means stop" contract every other gate in this file/`loop.py` already uses (mirrors
    `state.unsafe_goal_reason`, which `verify_goal` consumes the same way one gate earlier).

    Auto-rebase, not warn-only, is deliberate -- see the research for #1890 and
    plan #1890 for the full reasoning. In short: `rebase()` already exists, is already
    the unconditional remedy `merge()` reaches for on every BEHIND PR, and (as of #1890) is hardened
    to fail SAFE on both conflict shapes it can hit -- a committed-commit conflict and an
    autostash-pop conflict alike abort cleanly rather than ship broken code. A clean rebase is
    git's own three-way merge confirming the two sides never touched the same lines; a conflicting
    one is refused rather than papered over, by `rebase()` itself, for free.

    TWO DIFFERENT failure postures, not one blanket "fails open" -- found and fixed after
    independent pre-PR review reproduced the gap by execution: patched a fetch inside `rebase()`
    itself to raise and confirmed the exception propagated straight out of this function uncaught,
    contradicting the single "fails open" claim this docstring used to make everywhere.
      * BEFORE staleness is known (no work record, no worktree on disk, `_behind_count` itself
        cannot even complete -- offline, unreadable remote): fails OPEN. There is no signal either
        way, so blocking a verify that might otherwise run fine would be strictly worse -- this
        matches `root()`'s own never-raises contract and is exactly today's PRE-#1890 behavior for
        an unreachable remote.
      * AFTER staleness is CONFIRMED (`count > 0`) but the auto-rebase attempt itself raises rather
        than returning its normal descriptive string: refuses (a non-`None` string), same as a real
        conflict. Silently proceeding here would run the suite against code already POSITIVELY
        KNOWN to be behind -- precisely the bug #1890 exists to close, just relocated to this
        remediation step. `rebase()` already turns an actual git CONFLICT into a string rather than
        raising (both conflict shapes -- see its own docstring); an exception escaping it here means
        something else broke at the git/network layer partway through an otherwise-warranted
        attempt (its own internal fetch, the final push, or the reset/stash-pop undo). That is
        almost always transient (a network blip, a push race against ourselves), so it is reported

        `auto_unpark` ships off and skips any park with no machine-readable blocker. So one DNS
        hiccup during a supervisor relaunch removes the goal from the backlog until a human runs
        `/sigma-unpark`. That breaches "it recovers without a human" (AGENTS.md RESILIENCY).
      * release everything -- with a PERSISTENT transient (down remote, expired credential, wedged
        proxy) the loop becomes pick -> claim -> start -> release -> pick, spending a `gh issue
        edit`, a `gh issue comment`, a board write, a fetch and a rev-list per cycle while consuming
        ZERO budget, because `_release` deliberately never advances the cursor. That is `run_loop`'s
        own documented `poisoned` shape: "silently defeats `max_iterations` (worse than the original
        crash: loud and bounded beats silent and unbounded)".
    So: a CONFLICT parks on sight (nothing can self-heal two sides that touched the same lines); the
    first CONSECUTIVE transient releases (a blip, and a release costs no budget slot); the second
    parks; anything unrecognised parks, because failing toward human attention beats failing toward
    a silent retry loop.

    THE COUNTER LIVES IN THE WORK RECORD, NOT THE LEDGER. `ledger.enabled` ships FALSE, so a
    ledger-based bound would be inert on a stock config -- the "built on a subsystem that ships
    disabled" failure `_resume_blocked_by_a_live_sibling`'s own #1391 comment exists to stop
    repeating, and it would be absent on exactly the installs least able to notice. Same lazily
    written, absent-by-default shape as `review_cycles`. It is CONSECUTIVE: a clean pass clears it,
    without which a goal that hit one blip today would park on an unrelated one months later.

    WHAT THE RETURNED STRING MAY CLAIM. Only `state.advance_cursor` is certain. The ledger and
    action-log entries are fail-open (`safe_append` prints "entry skipped (non-fatal)" and returns
    `None`); the goal-file status and review-queue entry are written only in local-goals mode, where
    they raise rather than skip; and the label/comment/board writes are best-effort -- every `gh`
    call on both paths is caught on its own and cannot raise into this function (`release()`'s
    label removal and audit comment also write one stderr line and are recorded in
    `source.release_warnings()`, which nothing here reads). `source.release()`'s bool is NOT an
    answer either: its own docstring concedes "a nonexistent/deleted issue and a genuine release
    both return True here". So the string names what was attempted and how to finish it by hand,
    and asserts nothing about a remote write having landed.

    WRAPPED, deliberately. `state.park`/`state.release` read the goal file and `advance_cursor` can
    raise on a read-only `.sdlc`; uncaught, that propagates out of `start()` and `main()` reports it
    as exit 1 with the goal STILL CLAIMED -- the one outcome this function exists to prevent.

    RESIDUAL, named rather than left to be rediscovered: `transitioned` is set at FUNCTION-RETURN
    granularity, not per-mutation. An exception raised INSIDE `_record`/`_release` after the
    source-side write has already landed (a corrupt session file surfacing as a `JSONDecodeError`
    past `_session_release`'s `OSError`-only catch, say) still reports "STILL CLAIMED" for a goal
    that was in fact parked or released. Closing that needs the flag pushed down into `loop.py`'s
    own two functions, which is a wider change than this one; the exposure is a wrong sentence on a
    doubly-failed path, never a wrong TRANSITION."""

    per phase, not per pick, and not in a hook.

    NO LONGER THE WHOLE ENFORCEMENT SURFACE (#2116, #2574/S1-G3). That sweep's conclusion for the
    OTHER two keys has since moved, and all three are enforced now. `effective_hard_plan_gate`
    below wires `gates.hard_plan_gate` at `pr()`, so there are two GATED ACTIONS. The third is
    enforced by a different mechanism and deliberately not here: `ledger.journal_on()` reads the
    managed-settings FILE, because `ledger.append()` runs on every phase boundary and a subprocess
    there is the per-phase cost #1774's own body rules out. A `stat` is not — ~19 µs on this
    machine (Darwin 25.6.0/APFS), three orders below the subprocess that gap assumed, which is what
    retired it. `managed_settings.py` documents the file that carries those locks.

    `refusal` is None to proceed. A non-None `refusal` means the caller must PARK with that text:
    either org policy answered that this checkout is not authorized ("connected but
    unauthorized"), or it could not answer at all. Both fail CLOSED; both name themselves.

    `mode` is the value to gate on. When org policy is not adopted — no managed-settings file,
    which is every install in the wild today — it is exactly `review_mode(config)`
    and nothing is spawned. When it IS adopted, it is the resolved effective value, so an Org
    ceiling of `approval` gates a merge in a project whose own `config.json` says `off`. That
    inversion is the feature.

    ONE SEAM, TWO READERS OF THE SAME FILE. The subprocess resolves the Local tier from
    `<sdlc_dir>/config.json` on disk, which is the same file `state.load_config` produced the

    """(on, refusal) — `gates.hard_plan_gate` as the ORG-VERIFIED gate about to be applied.

    THE SECOND GATED ACTION (issue #2116; the first is `effective_review_mode` above, #1774/#2109).
    Until this shipped, `gates.hard_plan_gate` had exactly one outcome-changing reader in the whole
    tree -- `hooks/plan_gate.sh`, a Claude Code `PreToolUse` hook. An Org could lock the key, the
    UI said it was locked, and on Cursor and Codex it did nothing at all. AGENTS.md: "a Claude Code
    hook may be an accelerator, never load-bearing", and enforcing an org policy is load-bearing by
    definition.

    WHAT IS AND IS NOT CLAIMED. This makes the key UNIFORM across hosts; it does not make it
    un-routable. No Sigma Python entry point is mechanically un-skippable on any host -- `pr()`
    and `merge()` have zero Python callers, and #2109 has the same property. The defect this closes
    is the ASYMMETRY: enforced on one host, silently inert on two.

    `refusal` is None to proceed; a non-None `refusal` means the caller must PARK with that text.
    Both failure shapes (access revoked, and no verifiable answer) fail CLOSED and name themselves,
    reusing org policy's own four-status vocabulary rather than inventing a second one.

    `check` is injectable so a test can drive every branch without a real store -- and, unlike
    `effective_review_mode`'s own `check` (defined, injected by nothing), it is exercised: see
    `tests/test_managed_settings_gate.py`'s scalar-value cases, which reach the crash-shaped inputs a
    real store cannot easily be made to emit.

    A 2-tuple view of `effective_hard_plan_gate_locked` below (#2138), kept so every existing
    caller reads exactly as before; the memo in `_hard_plan_gate_refusal` is the one reader that
    also needs the LOCK bit and calls the 3-tuple directly."""

def _branch_touches_source(rec, run):
    """Does this branch's own diff against its base touch a file the plan-gate considers SOURCE?

    THE POINT IS TO NARROW, NEVER TO WIDEN. `hooks/plan_gate.sh` gates only source: it exits 0 for
    anything under `.sdlc/` or `docs/` whatever its extension, and for any extension outside its own
    list. A host-agnostic check without both exemptions would refuse pull requests the hook waves
    through -- a docs-only goal, or a `docs/tools/build.py`-only goal -- which is a behaviour
    WIDENING wearing a fix's clothes. So this can only ever turn a refusal into a pass.

    THE FILTERING IS DONE HERE, NOT BY A GIT PATHSPEC, and that is deliberate on two counts. The
    hook decides the same question with a shell `case` on the path, so doing it in Python is a
    translation of its rule rather than a second, differently-shaped one — `:(exclude)docs/**` is
    root-anchored where the hook's `*"/docs/"*` matches at ANY depth, and getting that mismatch
    right in pathspec syntax is a trap this simply does not need to enter. It also keeps the rule
    TESTABLE without a real repository: a fake `run` can return a file list, but it cannot emulate
    git's pathspec semantics, so a guard that delegated here would have had no executable control.

    FAILS CLOSED -- the opposite direction from `_plan_missing_from_branch`, deliberately. That
    guard fails open because it asks git to interpret the repo's own ignore RULES and a misread
    would wedge an unsatisfiable refusal. This one asks git a plain question about this branch, and
    the party best placed to make it unanswerable is the one the gate stops (the same reasoning
    every org-policy gate uses). An unreadable diff is therefore "assume source", and the remedy -- file the

def _hard_plan_gate_refusal(sdlc_dir, config, rec, goal, run, check=None):
    """The refusal line when this goal may not open a PR without a plan — "" otherwise (#2116).

    WHY HERE. `pr()` is the one host-agnostic point in the goal's life that is both outcome-changing
    and late enough to be about publication rather than typing; `pr()`'s own docstring already
    argues the case for the sibling plan guard, and every word of it applies: "`commit()` can be
    skipped for a whole run; `pr()` cannot", and refusing a PUSH leaves the branch, its commits and
    the worktree exactly as they were.

    AT MOST ONCE PER GOAL, AND THAT IS THE MEMO'S WHOLE JOB. `pr()` itself runs `1 + N` times
    (N = `sigma:block` cycles, capped at `work.max_review_cycles`), so a bare check here would
    run up to six times per goal against the issue's "at most once per goal". The ORG-POLICY
    ANSWER -- the only part that reads outside the local config -- is therefore memoised on the goal's own work
    record beside `review_cycles`, and every later call reads it. Memoising the VERDICT instead
    would not do: the org-policy check short-circuits for free only when the checkout is not
    ADOPTED, so a locally-off gate on an adopted checkout still reads the policy -- an Org lock over
    a local off being exactly the case the check exists for.

    A REFUSAL IS NEVER MEMOISED. Both org-policy refusals are conditions a human repairs (restore
    the grant, fix the policy file), so the next call must ask again. Everything below the memo is a free
    local read that re-runs every call, which is what keeps the answer correct as the branch grows:
    a docs-only cycle that later adds source is refused on the call that adds it.

    THE ORDER IS NOT ARBITRARY. The governed check runs FIRST, before the sentinel and before the
    diff, because a governed refusal is about AUTHORIZATION, not about this diff's contents. Consult
    the free local checks first and a member whose access has just been revoked skips the refusal
    with one `touch .sdlc/.allow-direct-edits` -- the refusal becomes optional for exactly the party
    it exists to stop. `merge()` calls `effective_review_mode` unconditionally for the same reason.

    THE SENTINEL IS A LOCAL ESCAPE HATCH FOR A LOCAL GATE, NOT FOR AN ORG LOCK (#2138). It is
    honoured only when the memo says `"on:unlocked"` -- the gate is on because THIS repo's config
    says so. Under `"on:locked"` the org has locked the key ON, and a file any member can `touch`
    is not a party that can waive an org policy; the refusal then names the lock and does not
    offer `touch` as a remedy, because it would be a false one. The lock bit therefore rides the
    memo (same once-per-goal grain as the answer it qualifies), and a pre-upgrade memo `"on"` --
    ambiguous about the lock -- is unrecognised on purpose, so a goal mid-flight at upgrade is
    asked again rather than read as unlocked. `hooks/plan_gate.sh` applies the same rule to the
    EDIT on Claude Code, so one key still gives one answer at both enforcement points.

    A revocation landing BETWEEN two `pr()` calls of one goal is not seen by this key -- it is still
    seen once per goal by `merge()`'s own check, which refuses a revoked member for any key, so
    nothing is lost at the goal grain both this issue and #1774 specify."""

    the push is the last gate before the plan's reviewer reads the branch, refusing a PUSH leaves
    the branch and worktree exactly as they were, and "`commit()` can be skipped for a whole run;
    `pr()` cannot". Plain Python, so it holds on every host; a hook would be an accelerator at most.

    WHAT IT HASHES: the PUBLISHED copy, `branch or main` from `plan_copies` -- what the PR carries
    and its reviewer reads; the main checkout's copy only when the branch carries none (a repo that
    ignores plans). `record_plan_review` recorded the verdict only for bytes every existing copy
    held, so a plan edited on either side after its review lands here as a mismatch.

    FAILS CLOSED on an unreadable or malformed record, an unreadable plan, and a `git` failure inside
    `plan_copies` (it propagates; `main()` prints it and exits 1 before the push). The gate is
    opt-in, the remedy costs one command, and the party best placed to break the record is the one
    the gate stops. NO PLAN IN EITHER COPY is silent -- `gates.hard_plan_gate` owns that, which is
    also what lets a design PR through -- UNLESS a record exists (R-d): that goal had a reviewed
    plan, so one deleted after its review is refused (one `exists()`, on the no-plan path only).

    fenced/substring mention is never mistaken for the real thing, F9), then across comments in
    chronological order.

    `same_author` (#821) is what lets `review_gate` tell a genuinely independent approval — a
    different account's comment, which is at least SOME identity signal GitHub itself didn't forbid
    — from the PR's own author approving its own diff via the self-usable channel this function
    exists to provide. It does not change WHICH directive wins or whether it's honoured (removing
    the fallback would leave a solo-account repo permanently unable to satisfy `approval` at all);
    it only lets the caller warn when that's what actually happened. None when there's no directive,
    or either login is unreadable — a signal this call cannot interpret must not itself block a
    merge, matching the fail-open unreadable-comments case below.

    #635: a marker counts only from a commenter whose `authorAssociation` is in
    `_TRUSTED_ASSOCIATIONS`; any other (or absent) is skipped with one stderr line naming the commenter
    and association. All three markers alike: a stranger can neither approve, nor park the loop with a
    block, nor clear a trusted block. RAISES `ValueError` when the comments cannot be read or parsed, or
    a marker comment has no `authorAssociation` field at all:
    the gate cannot know whether a trusted block exists, so `review_gate` parks (fails closed)."""

    """(ok, verdict) — the REAL review gate, independent of branch protection.

    `gate()`'s "safe" (mergeStateStatus) only folds in reviews the BASE BRANCH'S protection REQUIRES,
    so a human 'Request changes' on an unprotected base — the common shape for a staging/dev branch —
    is invisible to it, and an unattended `auto_merge` would land straight over it. This reads the
    ACTUAL review state and parks on it. `work.require_review`:
      off      — no gate (default; behaviour unchanged for anyone who hasn't opted in).
      changes  — park on a CHANGES_REQUESTED review, an unresolved review thread, or a `sigma:block`.
      approval — the above, AND require approval before merging: an APPROVED reviewDecision OR a
                 `sigma:approve` comment (park until then).

    THE SELF-AUTHORSHIP FALLBACK. GitHub structurally forbids approving / requesting-changes on your OWN
    PR, so on a repo where one identity opens AND reviews (a solo maintainer, or an org that pins all
    automation to one account), the formal APPROVE / CHANGES_REQUESTED signals can NEVER fire — `approval`
    would refuse forever. Plain comments have no such restriction, so `sigma:block` / `sigma:approve`
    are honoured as a self-usable equivalent, but only from an OWNER / MEMBER / COLLABORATOR commenter
    (#635). An unreadable COMMENT list fails closed (parks), as does an unreadable review DECISION under
    `approval`; under `changes` an unreadable decision still fails open (the other gates still hold, and
    that read must not be the thing that blocks a merge). Unresolved-thread count errors stay open.

    `mode` (#1774) overrides the local `review_mode(config)` read, and is how an Org's locked
    ceiling reaches this gate: `merge()` resolves it through `effective_review_mode` first and
    passes the answer down. `None` — every existing caller — keeps the exact local read this
    function has always done, so nothing that does not opt into org policy changes.

    THE FAIL-OPEN IN THIS FUNCTION IS NOT THE #1774 DECISION AND IS UNCHANGED. An unreadable
    GitHub review state still returns (True, "") here, exactly as before. That is a judgement
    about GitHub's API, made once the gate is already known to be ON; the fail-CLOSED decision
    #1774 makes is about whether the gate is on at all, and it happens one layer up, before this
    function is called at all."""

# #1474: the both-green CHECK -- is the other half of this cross-repo unit ready?
#
# GitHub cannot merge two PRs atomically, so a unit of work spanning two repos lands back to back
# instead, and the achievable guarantee is not atomicity but a CHECK: nobody lands while the other
# half is not ready. #1472 decided at PICK time whether this goal's unit spans repos and whether we
# can reach them all (tier 1); this answers, for a tier-1 unit, whether every OTHER repo in it has a
# landing PR that is green and approved.
#
# NOTHING IN THIS MODULE CALLS IT, AND THAT IS THE POINT OF THE WHOLE SECTION. It is a pure,
# queryable check whose consumer is #1478 (completion signalling). `sibling_gate`'s docstring
# carries the design contradiction that put it here and the contract #1478 inherits; read that
# before wiring it to anything.
#
# THE SEAM THIS IS REALLY ABOUT is the same one `_CHECK_PENDING` exists for one layer down:
# "has not answered yet" is NOT "failed". A sibling still building must WAIT; only a sibling that
# genuinely answered no refuses. So the per-sibling vocabulary has THREE members where two would do,
# and `_check_verdict` is REUSED rather than re-derived -- a second classifier of GitHub check states
# is a second opinion about them, and the whole reason #464's allowlist is an allowlist is that the
# obvious second opinion parks a goal (stripping `sdlc:goal`, dequeuing it until a human relabels)
# over a PR that was merely still compiling.

#: What one sibling PR is. `WAITING` is a first-class answer meaning the question was not answered,
#: and it is never a softer `NOT_READY` -- exactly `cross_repo`'s `unknown`/`denied` split, one layer
#: up. A `WAITING` sibling is re-read; only a `NOT_READY` one refuses on the spot.
SIBLING_READY, SIBLING_WAITING, SIBLING_NOT_READY = "ready", "waiting", "not-ready"

#: The single `gh pr list` read this gate makes per sibling per round. `isDraft`, `mergeable`,
#: `reviewDecision` and `statusCheckRollup` are the four facts `_sibling_pr_state` judges; `number`
#: and `url` exist so the refusal names the PR a human has to go and look at.
SIBLING_PR_FIELDS = "number,url,isDraft,mergeable,reviewDecision,statusCheckRollup"

#: How many open PRs on one head branch this gate will look at before calling it ambiguous. Small on
#: purpose: one head can legitimately carry PRs to two different bases, and the point of the cap is
#: to SEE the second one rather than to silently take the first.
SIBLING_PR_LIMIT = 5

#: This check's own "still not ready after the budget" prefix, deliberately NOT `PENDING_PREFIX`.
#: DEFENSIVE ONLY, AND SAID PLAINLY BECAUSE AN EARLIER REVISION OF THIS COMMENT OVERSTATED IT: today
#: `PENDING_PREFIX` has exactly one consumer, `merge()`'s `pending_arm`, and it reads `gate()`'s
#: verdict -- never this function's, which nothing in this module calls at all. So no live path
#: turns a shared prefix into a wrong merge, and claiming otherwise was a load-bearing role the code
#: does not give it. It stays distinct for the consumer #1478 becomes: a "still waiting on the
#: sibling" verdict that a future merge path mistook for `gate()`'s arm-worthy pending would arm
#: `--auto`, which lands OUR half the moment OUR checks pass with nothing re-reading the sibling.
#: Cheap to keep separate, and the mutation run confirms the separation is observable.
SIBLING_PENDING_PREFIX = "the other half of this cross-repo unit is still not ready"

#: The landing outcomes that leave this gate INERT, read off `cross_repo`'s own constants rather
#: than spelled as literals so the two files cannot drift apart on the vocabulary. Everything NOT in
#: here -- `flagged`, and any outcome a future release adds -- refuses. An allowlist for the same
#: reason `_CHECK_PENDING` is one: the failure mode of guessing wrong is a merge, not a park.

    A PURE, QUERYABLE CHECK. NOTHING IN THIS MODULE CALLS IT, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. It answers a
    question; it enforces nothing. Same shape #1470 shipped in: `feature_doc.sync()` landed pure and
    #1473 wires it. Its consumer is **#1478** (completion signalling), and the contract that goal
    inherits is at the bottom of this docstring.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WHY IT IS NOT WIRED TO `merge()`, WHICH IS THE FIRST THING ANYONE WILL WANT TO DO WITH IT

    It was, in the first revision, and review traced the chain that makes it wrong. Every link is in
    this tree:

      1. `cross_repo._check_at_pick` returns `NO_UNIT` when the issue declares no unit, and this
         check treats `no-unit` as inert. So `outcome == TIER_1` IMPLIES a declared unit.
      2. `start()` above resolves a declared unit's base to `features.BRANCH_PREFIX + unit`, i.e.
         `feature/<unit>`; `pr()` opens `head=sdlc/<n>`, `base=feature/<unit>`.
      3. `merge()` merges `rec["pr"]`, and `start()` only ever cuts `sdlc/<stem>` branches.

    So EVERY merge this module can perform is `sdlc/<n>` -> `feature/<unit>`, inside ONE repo. It
    touches `main` in neither repo and cannot land half of anything. Meanwhile the branch this check
    looks up is the registry's per-repo `branch`, which `features.py` is explicit is the UNIT's
    branch and not a goal's -- so the PR it looks for is the sibling's LANDING PR,
    `feature/<unit>` -> `main`. Wiring the two together fails in both directions: while a unit is
    being built no landing PR exists in either repo, so the first tier-1 goal in EACH repo refuses
    waiting for the other and the unit can never be built at all (symmetric deadlock, on the happy
    path, paid as a park -- which strips `sdlc:goal` and dequeues the goal); and once the sibling's
    landing PR is green, every unrelated goal merge passes vacuously.

    THE ROOT CAUSE IS A CONTRADICTION IN THE DESIGN, NOT IN THE CODE. §7.2 says Sigma "enforces
    this by refusing to merge while the sibling PR is not ready". §8 says completion is HUMAN-ONLY
    BY DEFAULT -- a person raises the feature -> integration-branch PR. Both cannot hold: §7.2
    assumes Sigma performs a merge that §8 says it does not. §8 wins, because it is the
    deliberate safety property and §7.2's clause is an implementation guess.

    THEREFORE #1474's THIRD ACCEPTANCE CRITERION -- "both green and approved merges the pair back to
    back" -- HAS NO OWNER IN THIS TREE, and that is recorded rather than quietly dropped. Nothing
    here merges a feature branch, so nothing performs the back-to-back landing. Giving it one is a
    decision for a human to take explicitly; #1478 is told not to fill the gap by accident.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WHAT IT DOES

    Returns `(True, "")` when the check does not apply at all -- the overwhelmingly common case, at
    ZERO API calls. `review_gate`'s own shape for `require_review: off`: an empty reason is how a
    caller tells "there was nothing to check" from "checked, and it passed".

    THE PICK-TIME DECISION IS READ, NEVER RE-TAKEN. `cross_repo.recorded()` takes no runner and has
    nowhere to put one, so this function structurally CANNOT perform the access check -- which is
    what makes "the access check happens at pick time, not at merge time" a property of the shape
    rather than a convention. It is also why there is still exactly ONE reader of an issue's declared
    unit in this tree: this check never asks what unit the goal belongs to, it asks what pick time
    already concluded.

    `recorded()` RETURNING `None` IS A REFUSAL TO ACT ON, NEVER AN IMPLIED TIER, and the two ways it
    can happen are told apart by the cheapest possible test -- the same one `cross_repo._check_at_pick`
    itself opens with. A project with no `.sdlc/features/` never adopted the branching model, so
    there was never anything to record and nothing to check. A project that HAS one records a
    decision for every goal the loop picks (`loop._check_cross_repo_at_pick`), including the
    `not-adopted` and `no-unit` cases, precisely so that a missing record means one thing only: the
    pick-time check never ran here. Not an inference either: `cross_repo._record` is best-effort by
    design and its own docstring already names this consumer's behaviour -- "a record that cannot be
    written costs the merge gate its shortcut -- it reads `None` and refuses".

    TWO WAYS A GOAL CAN BE PERMANENTLY UNREADY THROUGH NO FAULT OF ITS OWN, both found in review and
    both stated rather than left to be rediscovered. `_check_cross_repo_at_pick` runs only in
    `loop._next`, so (a) a goal claimed BEFORE its repo adopted the registry has no record and this
    check refuses for that goal forever after; and (b) a transient issue-read failure at pick records
    `flagged`, and `flagged` refuses on every later call. Both are recoverable by a re-pick, and both
    name themselves in the returned reason, which is why the reason is a sentence and not a code.

    FAILS CLOSED, which is the deliberate opposite of `review_gate`'s fail-open. That gate can afford
    to shrug at an unreadable review state because three others still stand behind it; here an
    unreadable answer is the only evidence there is, and the act a consumer might take on it is
    irreversible.

    NEVER RAISES, TOTALLY. The outer guard is what makes that a promise rather than an aspiration --
    the same shape and the same lesson as `cross_repo.check_at_pick`'s: a value read off an on-disk
    record that `recorded()` validates for `schema` and nothing else (a `unit` that is a list, say)
    used to raise `TypeError` straight out of a registry lookup, past every `except` inside. Anything
    that goes wrong is a refusal naming itself, never an exception the caller has to wrap.

      * `(True, "")` -- NOT APPLICABLE. No registry, not cross-repo, no unit, or tier 2. Zero API
        calls. Surface nothing; this is every ordinary goal.
      * `(True, "<reason>")` -- CHECKED AND READY. Every sibling repo has exactly one open PR on its
        registry-recorded branch, and it is green (and approved, if this project's `require_review`
        asks for approval). This is the signal #1478 exists to surface.
      * `(False, "<reason>")` -- NOT READY, and the reason says which of the eight causes it is:
        no record, an untierable decision, an unresolvable current repo, a record that does not name
        this repo, a record naming no sibling at all, no branch recorded for a sibling, no/ambiguous
        sibling PR, or a sibling PR that is draft / red / conflicting / unapproved / still building.
      * COST: zero calls when not applicable; one `gh pr list` per sibling when it is, plus one
        LOCAL `git remote get-url` only when `discovery.github.repo` is unset (#1577 -- this used to
        be a network `gh repo view`); and up to `PENDING_ATTEMPTS + 1` rounds (450s) when a sibling is still building
        or unreadable. A consumer on a latency budget should call it out of band, not inline.
      * IF YOU TURN A `False` INTO A PARK, CLASSIFY IT FIRST. Measured against `loop._reason_class`
        / `loop._mechanical_unknown_detail` over all 20 reachable reasons: 18 land in `unknown` and
        NONE is recognised as mechanical, so `decision_tier` would treat "gh answered nothing at
        all" as human-judgment prose -- the exact gap #1185 and then #1240 each had to close via
        `work.MECHANICAL_PARK_PREFIXES`. (The two that do classify, `changes requested` and `not
        approved yet`, land on `needs_decision` by colliding with `review_gate`'s needles, which
        happens to be right.) None of this bites today, because nothing parks on these -- and that
        is precisely why it is written down here rather than fixed speculatively: the remedy depends
        on how #1478 chooses to surface a `False`, and the mechanical ones belong in
        `MECHANICAL_PARK_PREFIXES` only once something actually parks on them.
      * DO NOT REINTRODUCE AN AUTOMATIC MERGE on the strength of a `True`. See the top of this

    "the merge closed it before `record done` ran" is the NORM for this repo's own PRs. On a
    `feature/<unit>` base nothing closes it, so the goal ships and its issue stays open — and the
    dependency gate, correctly, holds every dependent that declared `Blocked by:` it. Measured in
    the adoption trial: #1642 merged, stayed OPEN, and #1643/#1644 were held while the loop reported
    `DONE, nothing pickable`. This restores the default-branch norm for the base that cannot produce
    it; `complete()` then finds the issue already closed and takes the same path it already takes
    for GitHub's own auto-close.

    OBSERVE, NEVER INFER (#2615). The first version of this fix compared `rec.get("base")` --
    Sigma's own RECORDED target for this goal -- against the repo's default branch, and used
    that match/mismatch to decide whether the keyword had fired. #2572 showed why that is wrong in
    one direction (a recorded base that matches the default branch is not proof the keyword ran --
    the issue can still be open when this reads it) -- and #2615's own plan-review round 1 showed a
    live base is not safe either, in the OTHER direction: a PR opened against `feature/<unit>`
    carries `Refs #N` in its body (`_pr_body`'s own header, never a closing keyword for a
    non-default base), so if it is later retargeted onto the default branch before merging, GitHub
    still never runs the keyword against that body text -- a live base that now reads "default"
    would make the OLD logic wrongly skip the close. Both directions share one root cause: a base,
    live or recorded, is evidence about what SHOULD happen, never a confirmation of what DID. So
    this reads neither. Immediately after the merge lands, it asks GitHub directly whether the
    issue itself is still open (`gh api .../issues/<ref> --jq .state`, REST, the same call shape as
    the PATCH two lines below it) and acts on THAT answer alone. This also closes the race the
    base-comparison version had regardless of direction: that version's only live read was
    `gate()`'s, taken once before `review_gate`/`protection`/the merge call itself, so a retarget in
    that window reproduced the exact bug it was meant to fix. Reading post-merge has no such window
    -- there is nothing left between this read and the fact it is reading.

    OBSERVE THE CLOSE TOO, NEVER CLAIM IT (#2615's plan-review round 2, finding 1). The gap between
    THIS read and the PATCH two lines below it is not zero: GitHub's own keyword processing, or a
    person, can still close the issue in that window, and `-f state=closed` on an already-closed
    issue is an idempotent no-op success indistinguishable from a real close from the caller's
    side. So neither the returned clause nor the audit comment below ever says "closed by
    Sigma" or that the keyword "did not apply" -- both would be a claim about WHO closed the
    issue that this call cannot prove, only what it observed (open, or unconfirmed) and did (sent a
    close request that succeeded).

    ONE CALL SITE, AND IT IS THE EVIDENCE THAT PICKS IT. This runs only after `gh pr merge` returned
    success — the same moment, and the same proof, the honest `merged` ledger entry is written from.
    Not the arm: `--auto` only ARMS GitHub's auto-merge and returns immediately, which is why that
    path writes `merge-armed` rather than `merged` (F26/#344), and a later-failing check or a
    cancelled auto-merge means it may never land at all. Not `PR #N opened` (a fork PR nobody here
    can merge), not any `PARK:`. Every one of those is a PR that is not merged, and an issue whose
    work did not land must not be closed.

    THE SAME FIRST GATE THE BODY USES: `_reads_a_declaration` (github mode AND an issue-number
    stem — a LOCAL goal can be `.sdlc/goals/0002.md`, and closing a stranger's real issue #2
    unattended is the exact trap `_pr_body`'s own history is about). When it says no, this returns
    before reading or writing anything about the issue at all.

    THE ISSUE'S REPO IS `_issue_repo`, NOT THE PR'S. The goal number came from the discovery source;
    `{owner}/{repo}` resolves from the worktree's remote. On a fork that files issues elsewhere those
    differ, and the wrong one closes a stranger's #N.

    REST, never `gh issue view`/`gh issue close` — `pr()` and `_declared_unit` both carry the
    measurement: the `gh issue`/`gh pr` subcommands are GraphQL under the hood and GitHub meters
    GraphQL on a separate hourly budget, which has blocked this loop before (#1209) while REST
    still had headroom. This adds exactly one REST call where the base-comparison version also
    made exactly one (`_default_branch`'s own read) -- net zero new calls on the path that used to
    read the base, and the two writes below are unchanged and already REST.

    ALREADY CLOSED MEANS TOUCH NOTHING — not a PATCH (idempotent or not, it is a write nothing
    asked for), not a comment. This is the common, unremarkable case (GitHub's own keyword, on a
    default-base PR) and it produces the exact same silent no-op it always has -- but only once
    GitHub's own keyword processing has actually caught up with the merge by the time this reads
    the issue. That is never guaranteed synchronous with `gh pr merge` returning: if the keyword is
    still in flight, this read sees "open" on a default-base PR too, and the PATCH and comment below
    DO fire — redundant against a close about to land on its own, but harmless (the PATCH is an
    idempotent no-op success either way, and the comment reports only what was observed and done,
    never who actually closed the issue, per the section above).

    UNREADABLE STATE CLOSES DEFENSIVELY, THE SAME DIRECTION `_default_branch`'s OWN DOCSTRING
    ALREADY CHOSE for the read this replaces: being wrong toward "it is still open" costs one
    close attempt against an issue that may already be closed — harmless, since GitHub's own PATCH
    `state=closed` on an already-closed issue is a no-op 200, not an error — while being wrong the
    other way strands a landed goal's dependents open on nothing but an unlucky network blip. The
    returned clause says plainly that the state was never confirmed, rather than naming a fact
    (a base, a reason) this call never actually observed.

    CLOSE FIRST, NOTE SECOND, AND ONLY WHAT WAS CONFIRMED — `finish()`'s own rule for its branch
    deletes. A comment saying "closed by Sigma" on an issue Sigma failed to close would be
    another false machine-written line. FAIL-OPEN on the close itself, like every other post-landing
    courtesy here: the merge HAPPENED, and reporting it as a failure would send the caller to
    `record parked` for work that is already on the branch. But never SILENTLY, and never FALSELY
    either (#2615's plan-review round 3, finding 1): `record done` is not "nothing" -- its own
    `source.complete()` (#505's already-CLOSED probe, `else` branch) retries this exact close the
    moment it runs, because the state-probe above never marked the issue CLOSED, and `_record`
    (loop.py) parks the goal -- never silently drops the local record -- if that retry raises too
    (#1201). The returned clause names THAT recovery path, not a bare "nothing else will"."""

    subprocess cwd every later PR op (`gate`, `merge`, `rebase`, `post_review`, `pr`) runs in --
    deleting it while the PR is still open severs all of them from their own PR, with no
    sanctioned way back except hand-writing the state file. `auto_merge: off` (the shipped
    default) leaves exactly this: a `done` goal with an open, unmerged PR and nothing armed.

    Same fail-open shape as `merge_rights`/`done_refusal` elsewhere in this module: an unreadable
    state (no `gh`, no network, a non-object JSON reply) must never block `finish` -- only a
    POSITIVELY CONFIRMED `state == "OPEN"` does. A `MERGED` PR, or one `CLOSED` without merging,
    both proceed exactly as before -- neither has anything left for `finish` to sever.

    (#1218 review fix) Same `autoMergeRequest` truthy -> None carve-out `done_refusal` already
    has (this function's own cited template, module docstring above). `merge()` arms auto-merge
    with `gh pr merge --auto` and returns immediately -- it does NOT wait for GitHub's async merge
    to land, so an armed PR reads `state=OPEN` for some window (guaranteed for the #254
    pending-checks arm, where checks are by definition still running). SKILL.md routes
    'auto-merge armed' straight to `record done`, then unconditionally to `finish`, with no wait
    step -- so without this carve-out, `finish` refused the exact terminal-success state `merge()`
    itself, `done_refusal`, and SKILL.md's own documented flow all treat as nothing left to sever.

    (#1218 second review fix) This used to run `gh pr view` with `cwd=rec["worktree"]`. When that
    directory is gone from disk (container/disk reset, manual cleanup, CI runner wipe, or simply a
    DIFFERENT goal's `finish` having already pruned it -- exactly the precondition the "is not a
    working tree" recovery in `finish` below anticipates), `run()` raises FileNotFoundError, which
    landed in the SAME bare `except Exception: return None` meant only for "no gh"/"no network"/
    "non-object JSON" -- silently reproducing the exact #1202 bug (an open, unmerged PR's pointer
    destroyed with no check) this whole function exists to prevent. `gh pr view <number>` doesn't
    need the worktree specifically -- the PR number is already explicit -- so this now runs from
    `rec["worktree"]` only when that directory still exists, falling back to `project_root(sdlc_dir)`

    goal is a slow disk leak that also makes `git worktree list` unreadable. Refuses when the tree

    (#1202) Also refuses -- separately, before ever touching git -- when the goal's PR is still
    open and unmerged.  An armed PR (autoMergeRequest set) is released like any other open PR: it
    does NOT retain the checkout while waiting for GitHub to land it (round 3, B1 -- an earlier
    version tried retaining it "until a later finish can confirm the merge", but nothing ever calls
    a later finish, so every armed PR leaked its checkout forever). Observing the eventual armed
    merge without that leak needs a host-agnostic periodic sweep, filed as #2683.
    `--force` overrides all three refusals here (the open PR, git's own "still has work in it", and
    the disk-verified check below). `record done` itself
    already refuses when a mergeable PR was left unarmed (#254, see merge_rights), so a `finish`
    refusal here is only reachable via the legitimate `auto_merge: off` / fork / read-only paths

    still open/armed-but-not-landed, closed unmerged, unreadable) leaves both branches untouched,
    same as before this existed. The remote delete here is a BACKSTOP, not the primary path: a
    direct `merge()` landing already deleted it eagerly (see `_delete_remote_branch`); this exists
    for the goal that was armed and landed asynchronously instead, where nothing else ever revisits
    it. Best-effort and independently reported: the success message only claims a deletion that

    directory") -- NOT its branch name alone, because a design goal and its own later code
    implementation are cut from the IDENTICAL branch (`_design_branch`, work.py:4276) by
    construction, and NOT `.sdlc/design/<n>.md` alone either (round 4 review finding 1) -- a
    PR carrying only the machine artifact, without its required plain-language sibling, is not
    a genuine design PR by this repo's own writing rules. `row` (one element of `gh pr list
    --json ...`'s reply) counts as THIS goal's own design PR only if ALL of the following hold:
      0. `number` is a positive `int` and not a `bool` (round 4 review finding 2 -- Python's
         `bool` is an `int` subclass, so a naive `isinstance(number, int)` check alone would
         accept `True`/`False` as a PR number). Checked FIRST, before any other field: an
         otherwise-fully-valid design PR row whose own `number` is malformed must never be
         treated as "found", because a matched row's `number` is passed straight into `gh pr
         merge`/`gh pr close` and echoed in this module's own success text -- unlike every
         other check below, this one names no `ref` at all, because there is no valid number
         yet to render one from.
      1. `isCrossRepository` is the literal bool `False` -- same-repo only. Missing or
         non-bool is refused with its OWN phrase, distinct from "is a fork", because it is a
         different failure (unverifiable, not confirmed-cross-repo) -- AGENTS.md's "fails OPEN
         at the trust boundary" line names this exact confusion.
      2. `headRefName` equals `branch` (the caller's own `_design_branch(config, goal)`,
         re-derived by the caller and passed in here) -- defense in depth against a caller that
         skips `--head`, or a `gh` behavior change that stops enforcing it server-side.
      3. `files`/`changedFiles` are internally consistent and well-typed: `changedFiles` is an
         `int` and NOT a `bool` (Python's `bool` is an `int` subclass -- `changedFiles: True`
         equals `1` under `==`, so a naive `isinstance` check alone lets it silently pass
         whenever `files` has exactly one entry; round 3 review finding 2), `files` is a `list`
         of that SAME length, and every entry is a `dict` whose `path` is a `str`. A truncated,
         padded, or malformed reply is refused, never guessed.
      4. the path set includes `.sdlc/design/<n>.md`, `n = stem(goal)` -- an in-brief-only PR,
         or one that only happens to touch some OTHER file under `.sdlc/design/`, is not this
         goal's own design PR.

         goal's design files (or its own PLUS another's) alongside a legitimate-looking match.

    1-6); a fork is refused OUTRIGHT at check 1 with no further inspection -- mirrors
    `merge_rights`'s existing fork posture (work.py:2152-2156). Never raises.
