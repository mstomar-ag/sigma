"""The upkeep pass under the opt-in: the first live entry point behind the upkeep gate (project door).

WHAT IT DOES TODAY. One question and one record. `upkeep_pass` asks whether a long-lived unit branch has already LANDED in
its base, and if so skips it and says why. A landed unit is never moved to the base's tip. It does not rebase, push, back
up, resolve or file anything yet: a unit that has not landed comes back as `not-landed`, which is the hand-off point for
the engine slices that follow.

LANDED means one of two things, as one predicate:
  landed-contained  the unit tip is an ancestor of the base tip (a merge or rebase landing leaves it so);
  landed-pr         a merged landing request into the base has this exact unit tip as its head (the only thing that
                    recognises a squash landing). The requests are supplied by the caller as a callable returning
                    dicts with `merged` (true), `base` and `head_sha`; this module makes no network call. A unit that
                    later gets NEW commits has a different tip, so its already-landed commits are never replayed.

GATE. The decorator is the first action: with the gate closed nothing runs, nothing is read, written or spawned. The
decorator is the only reader of the config block.

TOTAL. A git question that cannot be answered (a failed or timed-out command, a name that is not a commit) reads as
`unreadable` and records nothing: "could not tell" is never "landed". Nothing here raises for a git failure.

STATE. A skip records the pass outcome `current` for the unit, with both tips, in the per-unit upkeep state (so the drift
measure counts from the right anchor and the backstop is not re-armed for a branch with nothing to do).
