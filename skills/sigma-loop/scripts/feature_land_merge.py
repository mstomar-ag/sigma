"""The landing engine, BACK HALF (#938, upkeep part C, slice 9): the guarded, head-pinned merge of one verified head.

A library loaded by path from `feature_land` (the front half) and never imported by the scheduler. The front half
verified a head T in a scratch tree, re-read both tips, and found an open non-draft pull request at T. This half does
the rest, in this order, and stops at the first refusal:

1. THE GATE. The upkeep project gate is the first call of the public entry; closed means no read, no write, no call.
2. LAST TIP RE-READ. The unit tip must still be T and the base tip must still be the one T was verified against.
   Otherwise refuse (`tip-moved`) before the guard, so an approval is not spent on a head that is already stale.
3. THE GUARD, LAST. `feature_land_approval.authorize`: attended consent, or the single-use approval consumed
   create-once and bound to T. Every other check has passed by then; nothing but the record and the call follow.
4. THE PENDING RECORD, THEN THE CALL. `feature_upkeep_landing.run_landing` writes the pending record BEFORE the call (no
   record, no call), makes the call, reads the pull request and the merge commit back, classifies and settles.
   The call carries T as its head pin, an explicit merge method, no auto-merge, no admin flag and no branch delete.
   A head that moved makes the host refuse; the read-back then shows the pull request still open: `refused`.
5. RECORD ONCE. On merged or merged-with-warning a create-once marker is taken, then the observation writer runs; a
   second completion finds the marker and records nothing.
6. THE BRANCH CHECK. A unit branch gone from the remote is reported with a restore hint and never recreated. Landing
   never deletes a branch and never marks the unit finished.

The base can move between the last re-read and the merge; a head pin cannot pin the base. That is detected after the
fact (merged-with-warning) and reported, not prevented. Live REST statuses are unverified; nothing here claims them.
Outcomes: `merged`, `merged-with-warning`, `armed`, `refused:<reason>`, `unconfirmed:<reason>`.
