"""#2311 (slice 1 of Epic #2310, design #2289): the passive drift watcher's real logic.

WHAT "DRIFT" MEANS HERE (design `## Intent`, `### 2`). For every OPEN unit's own `feature/<name>`
branch: (1) the COMMIT DELTA -- what the integration branch did while the feature branch was away,
via `feature_rebase.landed_commits` (BR-7), args reversed from its usual rebase-upkeep direction;
(2) the PR DRIFT -- the feature branch's own landing pull request, open or closed, via
`unit_completion._landing_pull_requests` (BR-8). Both are reused DIRECTLY, never reimplemented --
the whole point of the design's own Blast-radius section is that this repo already has both reads.

READ-ONLY AGAINST THE REPOSITORY. Nothing here moves a branch, opens a pull request, writes a
label, or touches a board column -- strictly informational, matching `## Blockers`: "the passive
tick is read-only... and defaults OFF."

THE GATE COMPOSES; IT IS NOT A FLAT FLAG (design `### 4`, mirroring `channel_notify.enabled()`'s own
two-part check, BR-11 `:64-74`). `enabled(config)` checks `ledger.enabled(config)` FIRST -- the
dedup mechanism below is built entirely on the shared ledger (`ledger.safe_append`/`read_all`
degrade to silent no-ops whenever the ledger itself is off), so `drift_watch.enabled: true` alone,
however it gets set, can never run the tick while the ledger stays off. D-2's addendum names the
unbounded, every-tick-every-machine failure this composition exists to close.

THE DEDUP MECHANISM IS SHARED, NOT LOCAL (design `### 4`, D-2). `channel_notify.py`'s own
NOTIFY-ONCE-PER-ID cursor (BR-11) lives in `.sdlc/state/` -- per-machine, never synced (BR-12) --
which is correct for a webhook that only ever wakes ONE person's own machine, and wrong for a
summary every teammate's clone could independently decide to post to a channel the WHOLE TEAM sees.
So this reads the SHARED ledger's own union (`ledger.read_all`, BR-10) for a `note` entry carrying
this window's own `ref`, from ANY actor -- not a local cursor -- and writes the marker back with
`ledger.safe_append` ONLY after a successful post. Residual: a bounded TOCTOU race (D-2) -- however
many watchers' reads land inside the gap before any of their own writes is visible to the others
will each post once -- scaling with how many watchers race in that narrow window, never with total
team size, and a duplicate post is a harmless repeated text summary, never a repository mutation.

TWO SEPARATE STATE ARTIFACTS, ON PURPOSE. The TTL watermark (`.sdlc/state/drift.meta.json`,
BR-6's shape, mirroring `loop._reconcile_due`/`_reconcile_stamp` exactly) is stamped on EVERY due
sweep regardless of whether the post succeeded -- so a persistently unreachable Slack endpoint costs
one failed POST per window, not a retry on every 15-minute `watch_daemon.py` tick forever. The ledger
marker is written only on a confirmed post -- so a failed post leaves the window genuinely open for
whichever watcher (this one, next window, or a teammate's, sooner) manages to post it.

UNIT ENUMERATION, WITH THE UNADOPTED FALLBACK (D-4). No `.sdlc/features/` directory at all: inert,
report nothing, cost nothing -- mirrors `unit_completion.py`'s own `NOT_ADOPTED` posture. A registry
that exists (even untracked/local-only, as measured live on THIS repo, BR-9) but declares no OPEN
units: also nothing to check, not an error. Every OPEN unit's own branch is checked; a bare
single-branch-against-`work.base` fallback was considered (D-4's own alternative) and left out here
-- comparing `work.base` against itself measures nothing, so there is no second fallback shape to
build.

Module shape follows its siblings (`reconcile_tick.py`, `channel_notify.py`): zero third-party
dependencies, loaded via `_load(name)`, never raises out of its own public entry points."""
