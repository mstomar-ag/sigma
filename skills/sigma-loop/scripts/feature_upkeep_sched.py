"""The upkeep scheduler: the machine-level decision step the ledger watcher runs once per tick, and the rows the doctor shows.

WHERE IT RUNS. `watch_daemon.tick()` loads this module lazily (once, cached) AFTER its eight calls and calls `scheduler_tick`
in its own guard. The decorator is the first action: gate closed means nothing is read, written or spawned, the tick log gains
no line and the heartbeat is not touched. The machine door needs the project opt-in, the machine variable AND the shared
ledger switch (see `feature_upkeep`). Nothing here reads the config block itself; settings come from the gate's reader.

WHAT ONE OPEN TICK DOES. (1) reaps a finished job and writes its outcome as an UNADDRESSED ledger note, in THIS process; (2) if
a job is still alive, stops there; (3) otherwise lists the registry's units (the include and exclude lists decide which),
drops those in their cooldown with a state read alone (no git), measures the rest within a per-tick time budget, and picks AT
MOST ONE due unit, the most behind first; (4) records the attempt BEFORE the work and starts the detached job; (5) writes the
status file. A unit it had no time to measure is not skipped for good: the status file keeps a cursor, and the
next tick resumes after it.

CEILING (stated, not discovered). One unit per tick is `86400 / interval` units a day: 96 at the 900 s default. A first
enable on N units with no state drains in N ticks, N / 96 days.

WHY THE WATCHER WRITES THE NOTES. A new writer process per run adds one ledger file and one inbox-cursor key per run, whatever
actor it is pinned to (measured: 1000 runs = 1000 files, 1000 keys). The watcher is one long-lived process: one file, one key,
ever. It writes as the configured actor else the shell user (never an actor lookup over the network), and never addressed.

PLATFORM. Windows is refused: the status file records the refusal once and no job is ever started there.
