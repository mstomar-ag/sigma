"""Bounded, unattended process runs: the shared verify runner and the process mechanism under it.

WHAT IT IS. A library (no command line) that runs ONE command in a process group of its own, under a wall-clock
budget, and returns a `Result` instead of raising (a bad budget is the one ValueError). Nothing in the product calls it yet: this release ships the
runner and the proof that it works; the upkeep job (a later slice) is its first caller, behind its own gate.

THE CONTRACT. `run_verify(command, worktree, timeout, ...)` is the verify entry. In order it: refuses a bad budget
(ValueError, the only way it raises); returns NO_COMMAND for an absent or blank command; REFUSES where process
groups do not exist (Windows); REFUSES, spawning nothing, when a repository-location variable is exported in the
process environment (git would then read the trust setting from the repository that variable names, not the
worktree's); returns UNTRUSTED, spawning nothing, unless the operator made the git-local shell-command decision for
that checkout (the refusal text is `shell_policy`'s own, verbatim); returns REFUSED, again spawning nothing, for the
project's main checkout, and with a different diagnostic when git cannot say what the directory is (verify runs in a
scratch worktree only); then runs the command.
`run_group(...)` is the mechanism underneath and is also what the unattended git runner is built on.

HOW A RUN ENDS, and what is left behind (the answers were measured, see the plan record of this change):
  * the command exits: OK for exit 0, FAILED otherwise. Anything it left running in its group is swept (TERM, a
    grace, then KILL), so a run never leaves a process behind.
  * the budget runs out: TIMEOUT. The WHOLE group is stopped, not just the shell: SIGTERM first, a grace, then
    SIGKILL for what is left. TERM comes first because a git process killed outright while it holds a reference lock
    leaves the lock behind and every later fetch fails until a person removes it.
  * the stop file appears (polled every POLL_SECONDS): STOPPED, the same way. The runner never deletes the file; it
    belongs to whoever created it.
  * the caller itself dies (even by SIGKILL, which no handler sees): a tiny lifeline process in a session of its own
    watches a pipe whose write end only the caller holds, and on end-of-file stops the group the same way. A tree in
    its own session would otherwise outlive a killed caller.
  * the platform cannot give the group guarantee: REFUSED, loudly, rather than a kill that cannot reach the tree.

OUTPUT IS BOUNDED. Pipes are read without blocking into a ring that keeps the LAST `tail_bytes` (merged stdout and
stderr), or, in split mode, the first `max_out_bytes` of stdout and the last `tail_bytes` of stderr. A command that
prints 200 MB costs a bounded amount of memory, not a multiple of its output: MEASURED, merged mode keeps about the
tail plus one chunk, and split mode peaks near three times `max_out_bytes` (the kept bytes, a copy made to decode
them, the decoded text), so the default 16 MiB cap peaked near 74 MiB under a 300 MB flood (the earlier 64 MiB cap
peaked near 227 MiB, hence the lower figure). A descendant that escaped the group
(its own session) and still holds a pipe cannot stall the run: after the group is stopped the pipes are drained for
at most REAP_SECONDS and then closed.

THE ENVIRONMENT is the caller's, with the repository-location variables git reads removed and the prompt pins added
(`unattended_env`): no prompt, no editor, no askpass helper. The command inherits the operator's other variables,
credentials included; a caller that needs an allowlist passes `env`.

NOT HERE, ON PURPOSE. No configuration is read (the budget is a parameter; the caller derives it), no gate is
consulted, no file is written, no claim or ledger entry is armed, nothing from the loop script is loaded. The only
sibling loaded is `shell_policy`.
