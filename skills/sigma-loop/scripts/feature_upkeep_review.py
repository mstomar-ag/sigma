"""The independent reviewer route for a resolved unit conflict (upkeep part B, slice 9; #950).

A library, loaded by path; no command line, nothing at import time, and NOTHING CALLS IT YET: the caller is the upkeep
pass, behind its gate. While the gate is closed (the default) `review` returns `closed` having read nothing, written
nothing and spawned nothing.

WHAT IT BINDS. A second headless session, started through the resolver launcher (`feature_upkeep_launcher.py`: the same
isolation, environment rules, metering and ceilings), given a brief of the base, ours, theirs and resolved contents of the
conflicted files plus the capped pull-request descriptions, and NO resolver transcript: the request has no field that
could carry one. WHAT IT CANNOT PROVE: that the resolver did not influence the reviewer (they share a repository, a
catalog, a team ledger and an operator). It is a separate session given a different brief, nothing stronger. The route is
labelled `verified: false` in every result until it has run end to end against the real command line.

THE ORDER of `review(request)` (it returns a `Review` and raises only for a programming error):
  1. the gate: the project block on and `conflicts.resolve` set to `agent`, else `closed`;
  2. the mechanism: `inline` (a self-review) and `subagent` (cannot be spawned from Python) are refused by construction,
     and so is anything else that is not `headless`;
  3. the unit name, then the caps (the reviewer's cap must be smaller than the resolver's), then the model: the catalog
     id that differs from the resolver's when a second exists, else the placeholder, which keeps the route closed;
  4. the brief is built, and the leak gate `reviewer._check_brief_text` runs over the exact text that will be sent;
  5. a write-once manifest is written (unit key, base, head, resolved tree, each path with its sha256, the brief's sha256);
  6. the launcher runs the session;
  7. the reply goes through a strict local validator; anything else, an unreadable reply and a timeout are `block`;
  8. the tree is re-read and compared with the manifest BEFORE a verdict is accepted; a moved tree is `block`.
It never calls `reviewer.resolve` and adds no key to the host command table, so the session markers a background job may
have inherited cannot route it and `review.host: claude` for ordinary pull-request reviews is untouched.

THE REVIEWER CAN ONLY ADD A REFUSAL. An `approve` here is one input to the caller's gate; it never overrides a refusal.

UNVERIFIED, and labelled where used: the shape of the reply envelope of `claude -p --output-format json` (this module
accepts either the bare verdict object or an object whose `result` is the verdict as text; nothing here ran the real
command line), and the CLI's schema flag, which is not used.

THE STORE: `<sdlc>/state/upkeep/reviews/<unit-key>/<generation>.json`, one manifest per review, never rewritten. At most
MAX_GENERATIONS per unit; `prune` ages them out. Empty unit directories are left (one per unit, bounded by the unit count).
This namespace is its own: it never shares the goal-keyed review generations or their pruner.
