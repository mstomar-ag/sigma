"""sigma-rebase, slice 1 (#2304, epic #2303, design #2288 §2-§4): the
decision-context brief and the clean-path rebase for a manually-triggered, human-attended
companion to `feature_rebase.py`'s automatic upkeep pass.

WHAT THIS IS FOR. `feature_rebase.py`'s `upkeep()` already detects a conflict correctly and files
it as tracked work -- but it never explains WHY a rebase is needed, and its only action on a
conflict is to abandon the throwaway worktree and hand a human a raw `git` error. This module is
the resolution-and-explanation half: before touching anything, it assembles a brief of what the
base branch did while this branch was away and WHY (from CHANGELOG.md, PR descriptions, and linked
design docs), flags the files most likely to conflict, then attempts the rebase. On a genuine
conflict it shows that file's own decision context and stops -- strictly better than a bare error,
even before the interactive conflict-options walker (slice 2, #2305) lands.

REUSED, NEVER REINVENTED:
  * `feature_rebase._settings`/`_remote` -- `work.base`/`work.remote` resolution, unconditional,
    the same fallback `feature_rebase.py`'s own `_upkeep()` uses, so a repo with no
    `.sdlc/features/`, or a branch that is not `feature/<name>`, still resolves cleanly (design
    D-4 -- this skill works generically, "across the repos this org runs").
  * `feature_rebase.landed_commits` -- the exact first-parent delta walk, reused in the OTHER
    direction here: what the BASE did while this branch was away, rather than what landed ON a
    feature branch.
  * `feature_rebase.rebase_stopped` -- the structural (never exception-text) test for "did a
    rebase actually stop here", reused directly to tell a genuine conflict apart from a git call
    that simply failed to run.
  * `changelog_coverage.extract_issue_ids` -- pulls every `#N` out of a text as a SET, loaded by
    path exactly as `feature_rebase._load` already loads its own siblings and exactly as
    the release-CI script's own test already loads this module -- when it is present. It is
    sigma's OWN release-CI script under `.github/scripts/`, not part of what a plugin install
    ships to an adopting repo (`skills/sigma-release-check/SKILL.md` already runs it by a bare
    repo-root path for the same reason), so a plugin install elsewhere genuinely will not have it.
    `_changelog_coverage()` degrades to a one-line local port of the identical technique in that
    case, so behaviour is the same whichever branch is taken.

DELIBERATELY NOT REUSED: `feature_rebase.arrived_through_a_pull_request`. Its two regexes are
`\\Z`-anchored to the TRAILING number in this repo's own dominant squash shape (`<title> (#issue)
(#PR)`) -- correct for "did a pull request land this", wrong for "which issue does the CHANGELOG
key this to" (the heading is keyed to the issue, never the trailing PR). `_pr_number` below still
borrows those same two regexes' own anchoring -- to find WHICH match is the PR reference, never an
earlier issue reference in the same subject -- then reuses `_ISSUE_RE`'s own capturing group (the
identical regex `changelog_coverage.extract_issue_ids` already uses) to pull the number out of
that one match, for the one place a PR number specifically is needed: the `gh pr view` fallback.

RUNS AGAINST THE HUMAN'S OWN LIVE CHECKOUT, not a throwaway worktree (design D-2) -- unlike
`feature_rebase.py`'s ephemeral detached replay, this skill's whole premise is a person sitting at
their own terminal on their own branch.

CLI: `rebase_brief.py brief <sdlc_dir> [branch]` (assemble and print the brief, touch nothing) |
`rebase_brief.py rebase <sdlc_dir> [branch]` (assemble, print, then -- only when `branch` is the
CURRENTLY checked-out one -- attempt the rebase; on a conflict, print that file's own decision
context and stop, leaving the tree exactly as `git rebase` itself leaves a stopped one)."""

# WHAT THIS IS FOR. `file_context` above re-derives its answer from whatever `merge_base`/`base_ref`
# it is handed -- correct for the brief's own one-shot print, wrong once a conflict's resolution
# spans two separate process invocations (a human runs `rebase_brief.py rebase`, hits a conflict,
# and only later runs `conflict_walk.py walk` to resolve it -- design #2288 §5's
# own "a later slice"). If the base advances in between, re-deriving against the NOW-moved
# `base_ref` can describe an entirely different commit -- reproduced live (#2321): a conflict
# correctly classified as a content clash, whose context text cited an unrelated file-deletion
# commit that only became "the" deleting commit once the base moved further.
#
# THE FIX: capture `file_context`'s own answer ONCE, at first detection, and persist it where a
# later, separate process can read it back -- `.sdlc/state/rebase-context/<branch-stem>.json`,
# following this codebase's OWN convention for a per-branch/per-goal scratch file keyed by an id
# that may contain `/` (`diff_revert.scratch_dir`, `witness.path`: `str(id).replace("/",
# "_").replace("..", "_")`), under `.sdlc/state/` (gitignored, per-machine runtime --
# `setup.RUNTIME_IGNORES`), written atomically (`mkstemp` + `os.replace`, `state.py`'s and
# `triage._atomic_write_text`'s own standing publish tail) so a reader never observes a
# half-written store.
#
# NOT A ONE-SHOT CACHE FOR THE WHOLE REBASE. Keyed by `path` inside one per-branch store so a
# SECOND, later conflict on a different file gets its own independent entry; `discard_context_
# snapshot` drops a path's entry the moment it is actually resolved, so if that SAME path conflicts
# again later in this same rebase (a different commit touching it a second time), the next ask
# finds nothing cached and captures fresh -- never answers from the first conflict's now-stale
# entry. `clear_context_snapshots` wipes the whole per-branch store once a rebase concludes cleanly
# (`conflict_walk.walk_conflicts`'s own DONE/ABORTED outcomes) -- SCALABILITY: nothing here is left
# to grow without bound, and a stale leftover from an abandoned attempt never has old data.
#
# `sdlc_dir` FALSY DEGRADES TO NO PERSISTENCE, NEVER A CRASH: any caller that does not have (or does
# not care about) a `.sdlc` directory -- most of this suite's own existing tests -- gets exactly

    skill performs, so there is exactly one call site to reason about rather than several that
    could quietly drift apart (#2319: `conflict_walk.walk_conflicts` reuses this directly for its
    own post-resolution push instead of hand-rolling a second copy).

    Never raises: a stale lease means somebody else pushed to this branch between our fetch and
    this push -- their commits are intact, ours are still local and nothing was overwritten. That
    is the mechanism working, not a failure to hide from the human; report it plainly so they can
    re-run (fetch again, brief/walk again) rather than silently losing the local work.

    #144, review block #2: THE TREE GUARD LIVES HERE, at the single chokepoint, so every caller is
    behind it -- `attempt_rebase`, `conflict_walk.walk_conflicts`'s DONE push, its
    `_manual_recovery_push`, and Slack's `--rebase` (which calls `attempt_rebase`). Before pushing,
    HEAD is compared against `<remote>/<branch>` -- exactly the commit the lease will overwrite --
    with `feature_rebase.dropped_paths`; a HEAD that would remove or roll back content that commit
    has is REFUSED and nothing is pushed. No remote-tracking ref means nothing is overwritten (the
    lease then only creates the branch), so there is nothing to lose. A comparison that cannot be
    made (or times out) is a refusal too, never a pass. The LOCAL branch is left as it is: the
    refusal says how to put it back. `accepted` names paths a human explicitly resolved in this
    session (the walker's own `resolved` list): their loss is the human's decision -- ABANDON on a
    deleted-by-us file IS a deletion -- so only OTHER paths can refuse the push. The manual-recovery
    push has no such record and passes none, so everything it would lose refuses it.

    #278: `pre_head` is the head the branch had BEFORE the rebase being pushed; what the rebase
    itself loses (`pre_head` -> HEAD) is always measured. A loss already present between the remote
    tip and `pre_head` is exempt ONLY when it is the branch's own deliberate local DELETION --
    `feature_rebase.own_losses` against `base_ref` (a local, unpushed `git rm` commit of a path the
    base left alone: exempt; a ROLLBACK or any modification in that range, and losses attributable
    to a fetched upstream after an earlier LOCAL rebase: refused -- review blocks #1 and #2,
    subject to the current-ref provenance limits in branching-model §15). No `base_ref`, or a shallow
    clone, exempts nothing. All the guard's reads for one push share one wall-clock budget
    (`feature_rebase.guard_deadline`, `SIGMA_WATCH_CALL_TIMEOUT`); running out refuses.
    `None` derives `pre_head` from git's own record: when the branch reflog's newest entry is a
    rebase's own `(finish)` line for this branch, the pre-rebase head is `<branch>@{1}`
    (`pre_rebase_head`). Unknown (no such entry, reflogs off) falls back to the remote-tip
    comparison alone. Either way the fallback exempts nothing: it can refuse a healthy local
    deletion, and it never exempts a loss the attribution rule would refuse (a loss of content the
    remote never had, with no pre-rebase head to measure from, is not seen -- `_would_lose` and the
    refused-push marker cover the paths this skill itself rebases). The undo advice names
    `pre_head` when known, never the remote tip, because resetting to the remote tip would throw
    the unpushed local commits away. That reset only undoes the latest rebase. The refusal also
    names the retained remote commit as a content-recovery source for losses predating it.

    A branch a refused replay could not put back (`feature_rebase.push_refused`'s marker) is refused
    before anything is measured.
