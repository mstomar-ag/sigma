"""Sigma must never autonomously delete a `feature/<name>` branch (issue #1819).

`docs/branching-model.md` (S13/S13a) already treats `feature/<name>` as long-lived: finishing a
unit is a REGISTRY EDIT (`open: false`), never a branch deletion. A prior audit found no code path
in the kit deletes a `feature/<name>` branch today -- but that was true only by absence, never
checked or stated as an invariant. This file makes it checked (S13b in the doc is the stated half).

WHAT THIS PROVES, in two parts:

1. STRUCTURAL INVENTORY (`_delete_call_sites` + `test_every_delete_shaped_call_site_...`). Every
   `.py` file `git` tracks under `skills/` or `hooks/` is scanned, with comments and docstrings
   blanked out first (a tokenize pass, not a raw substring scan -- see `_python_scannable_lines`),
   for seven kinds:
   - `branch_dD`    -- `git branch -d/-D <name>` (a local delete)
   - `push_delete`  -- `git push ... --delete <name>` (GitHub's explicit remote-delete flag), or
     the short `push ... -d` flag on the same line
   - `rest_delete_ref` -- a REST DELETE in any spelling (`-X DELETE`, `--method DELETE`,
     `--method=DELETE`, `-XDELETE`) on a line that also names a `.../git/refs/...` endpoint
   - `rest_delete` -- the same REST DELETE verb with no `git/refs/` on its line. The endpoint may
     sit on another physical line (`gh_api.remove_label` builds its argument list that way), so the
     guard cannot tell a ref delete from a label delete and flags both for review
   - `update_ref_delete` -- `git update-ref -d/--delete <ref>`, optionally after `--no-deref`. Only
     the delete forms: a plain `update-ref <ref> <sha>` is not a deletion and stays quiet
   - `gh_api_delete` -- a `gh_api.delete...(` helper call, on a `gh_api` name or on a
     `_load("gh_api")` style loader receiver
   - `colon_refspec` -- a two-sided push refspec `<src>:refs/...` (heads, or any other namespace)
     -- git's THIRD, easy to miss delete syntax: when `<src>` is empty, `git push` DELETES
     `<dst>`. This is not itself a deletion, but a BUILD SITE for one, and it is exactly the shape
     a naive "just check for -d/-D and --delete" scanner would miss entirely.
   The inventory is then pinned to the EXACT, already-reviewed set of sites this scan currently
   finds -- a SEVENTH site appearing anywhere (a new delete, or a new unaudited colon-refspec build)
   fails the pin immediately, by file, function and kind, forcing a conscious decision rather than
   a silent regression.

2. BEHAVIORAL PROOF for the two shapes that are structurally live. `work.py`'s `finish()` and
   `merge()` really do delete a branch (the GOAL's own throwaway `sdlc/<goal>` branch, once its PR
   is confirmed merged) -- so the inventory pin alone is not enough; this proves that even when the
   SAME goal's `base` is a `feature/<name>` unit branch, no delete-shaped call ever names it.
   `feature_rebase.py`'s colon-refspec site is proven safe differently (its source side is the
   fixed literal `"HEAD"`, never a variable) and `define.py`'s is proven safe via `resolved_base()`
   never returning a falsy value.

WHY TOKENIZE, NOT A RAW SUBSTRING SCAN. `_delete_remote_branch`'s own real docstring in
`work.py` contains the literal prose `"gh pr merge --delete-branch"` -- a raw scan for the
substring `"--delete"` would flag its own explanatory comment. `_python_scannable_lines` (the same
shape `tests/test_no_unsupervised_process_pause.py` already established in this repo, reimplemented
here rather than imported -- this repo has no shared test-helper module) blanks every `COMMENT`
token and every triple-quoted, non-f-string `STRING` token via the stdlib `tokenize` module, leaving
ordinary string literals (`"branch"`, `"-D"`, `"DELETE"`) -- exactly where the real git/gh
arguments live -- fully scannable.

WHY TRACKED FILES, NOT `Path.rglob()`. This repo's own `tests/test_self_contained.py`
(`_tracked_files()`) already fixed this exact defect class (#1434, #1461, landed as #1821 the same
day as this file): a raw filesystem walk picks up untracked clutter -- a stray local scratch file,
a `.claude/worktrees/` checkout -- that never ships and is not this project's code. `_owned_py_files`
below asks `git ls-files` the same way, so a stray untracked `.py` file on a developer's disk (or a
concurrent goal's own worktree) can never spuriously trip the inventory pin at `verify` time.

NAMED, ACCEPTED GAPS. Like the SIGSTOP guard, this is a TEXT/line scan, not a full data-flow
analysis: a delete-shaped call built with the flag as a separate list element assembled across
several statements (rather than one contiguous literal call) would not be caught. Each pattern is
also matched PER PHYSICAL LINE, not per logical statement, so a call deliberately wrapped across
multiple lines can split a pattern's two halves onto different lines and slip through (`push` and
`-d`, `update-ref` and `-d`). Three more gaps are known: a colon-empty refspec whose colon is built
dynamically (a `":%s"` format, an f-string) has no literal `:refs/` on its line; a `gh_api`
receiver bound to a variable first, or a bare `from gh_api import ...` name, is not recognised;
and files under `tools/` and shell scripts are outside the scanned tree. Every one of them is
pinned as a KNOWN LIMIT by `test_known_limits_of_the_per_line_scan_are_pinned` in
`tests/test_never_delete_guard_backup_refs.py`, rather than papered over with a multi-line join --
closing a gap is a conscious edit of that test. The write-surface scanner
(`tools/readiness/write_surface.py`, AST based) covers `tools/`, shell scripts and the dynamic
colon builds. This closes the LIKELY reintroduction shape -- a literal `git branch -d/-D`,
`--delete`, REST DELETE, `update-ref -d` or colon-refspec construction, written the way every real
call site in this repo already is -- not every conceivable way to construct one dynamically.

THE BACKUP-NAMESPACE RULE. What this guard enforces about `refs/sigma/backup/` is stated once, in
`NEVER_DELETE_BACKUP_RULE` below, and pinned verbatim by
`tests/test_never_delete_guard_backup_refs.py`; `_files_carrying_the_rule_wording` finds any other
tracked file that states it, so a copy cannot drift unlisted.
